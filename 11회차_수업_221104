speaker A
00:00
To give light to me because the room is still a little bit dark. 

speaker B
00:06
I have seen that from only pictures not in unity ling light. Wow. 

speaker A
00:17
It gives you light in your face and it makes you handsome or beautiful. It gives me light because I cannot turn on the lights in my room because my husband is still sleeping. So my mom bought me this one. There are different series actually. That one. That one. 

speaker B
00:42
Maybe I should try one. 

speaker A
00:45
Actually, people who are using mostly on online online sellers, online jobs, usually they have this one too. Usually this makes your appearance good. It's actually very cheap. Very, very cheap. Maybe you can have this in Korea. There are also products. I think my mom bought this in a Korean store online. From Manila. From Korean store from Manila. Actually it's great. You don't need to worry if you're going to look dark when you do some video things on the internet. 

speaker B
01:38
Maybe for a present, I should buy one for my friends. 

speaker A
01:48
This is just a case. It has a stand already on it. It's complete package. It has different lights. Actually that one and the yellow one, which I can use on the daytime if the sun is already bright. And then there's like the bluish white which I am currently using right now. So you can adjust also the brightness if you want to make it brighter. I will make it brighter. It's very bright. Just to like it very bright. It's actually very useful. It's cheap and very convenient to use. I can just even bring this anywhere I can if I want to have glass. Very convenient. Thank God. It's pretty new. 

speaker B
02:46
I'm traveling, so by every day is Friday. 

speaker A
02:54
I think it's going to be a bit busy weekend for me. Why tomorrow? Mostly the busiest is, I guess, sunday. Tomorrow is just a regular day, class day. Sunday. Because Monday is the birthday of my sister and Wednesday is the birthday of my husband. So Sunday I'll be from the morning I'm going to be spending with my husband's family and relatives. It's a little pre birthday celebration because some of my husband's family and relatives cannot join us here on his birthday. So there's a little celebration there. And then lunchtime. And then by around 05:00 p.m., we're going to go to my sister's house. There's going to be another pre birthday celebration. So it's eating time. There's going to be a lot of eating. 

speaker A
03:56
Probably I'm going to be drunk Sunday. 

speaker B
03:59
You have many scheduled parties. 

speaker A
04:04
Yeah, but the BCS will be on Wednesday on his birthday. Because I'm going to be we don't have any housekeepers. So from the preparation in the afternoon, you know, preparing the table, the karaoke, what else? The recalling the food services. Because the food will be catered foods, desserts, cakes will be catered. So everything from the start to the end of the party on Wednesday, that's going to be morally on me. Because of course, I cannot make my mother in law do everything. She's a little bit old. So it's going to be not good for her. I'm going to be sharing you the foods. I will always take pictures of the foods on the birthday of my husband. So by Thursday I can share to you. Pictures? No, Wednesday afternoon I can already send pictures of how Filipinos celebrate birthday. 

speaker B
05:05
I wondered that. I'm so curious. And you just heard about the karokay. Do you do cara k things at first day? 

speaker A
05:28
Usually, yes. If your TV is for good for cara. Okay. You just have the equipment? Yeah, mostly here. Karaoke. With the dancing, we don't need to go to karaoke room. As long as you have the laptop, the box, then music starts. Filipinos love singing. 

speaker B
05:54
And you just heard that about catering? 

speaker A
06:02
For catering services, we don't need to cook. Instead we ordered a particular food catering services and they will just deliver it. So we don't need to be tired of preparing the foods. Everything from there? No, we just have to cook the rice here. We have to cook the rice here. So all dishes and the dessert and the soft drinks are catered by the services. 

speaker B
06:35
Is he Hughes party? 

speaker A
06:40
Yeah. My husband, ever since he was young, because he's the only boy in the family. So even her, his relatives, his aunties and uncle gives him really special treatment because he's the only boy. So there's always a party for him. We don't really invite a lot of people like close family. I know family is always there. Close relatives and close friends or neighbors usually like that. We don't really invite everyone that we know. Just those close friends, relatives, not all, but usually there are still leftover foods. Because karaoke here limits until 11:00 p.m.. So we will start the karaoke around. The operator of the karaoke will arrive here Wednesday. 

speaker A
07:43
430. So from 430 the singing starts already. 

speaker B
07:49
And I want to sing too. I want to sing if I'm going to be drunk. 

speaker A
08:00
Yes, I sing too. I'm not a good singer, but I can sing. My husband has a good voice too. 

speaker B
08:07
What is your favorite song? 

speaker A
08:11
The usual song that I always sing. It's actually from Noel. I don't know if it's originally from a Hollywood singer, but it's most likely a heartbroken song. Like for songs that if you're heartbroken, you can relate to that song. But actually I just like that song. No other meaning, no other definition. But I just really like that song. It's high peach songs. I like singing it. Do you want me to record a video of me singing? Maybe when you see my video singing, you will change teacher. 

speaker B
09:01
Is it the title of the song? 

speaker A
09:05
No, the title of the song is what is this? 

speaker B
09:14
You made me stronger. 

speaker A
09:18
I think the singer is regine the Last Philippines. 

speaker B
09:25
Is it hard to believe? 

speaker A
09:28
Is it hard to believe I'm okay. After all. It's been a while since that's it. You're going to change teacher the next week. Oh my God. But I can say I am much more better singer when I'm drunk. 

speaker B
09:52
Thank you for sharing your singing talent. 

speaker A
09:59
Oh my God. Don't change teacher because I sang. Okay. That was perfect. My husband really also actually, we also have a singer this Wednesday. The boyfriend of my mom is a singer. He's really a known singer here. He even joined competition in Manila. He's a very known singer here around the city. So he will be the one to operate the karaoke and sing songs. 

speaker B
10:40
Wow. It is very huge party. Wow. 

speaker A
10:45
I hope I can drink that time well. All I can do is to clean up and do things. Good thing we don't need to wash dishes that time. Because we're going to be using paper plates, disposable plates on the party. But Korea doesn't really do these kinds of party, right? Even gathering families, friends and relatives, right? 

speaker B
11:12
Yes. We usually celebrate one's birthday with only few people or few friends. Maybe father and some siblings. 

speaker A
11:31
Usually it's just a simple dinner in a restaurant and a blowing of the cake, right? 

speaker B
11:36
Yes, right. 

speaker A
11:40
I'm sure when you see my pictures and I can also put some videos of our surroundings, I'm sure you're going to be wowed. Like you can really say wow. That's how Filipinos celebrate birthdays. You too late into me. 

speaker B
12:01
You're a good singer too. 

speaker A
12:05
Maybe I just drank water today. Anyways, it's going to be there for these coming days. It's a little bit busy and after my husband's birthday is going to be nothing. I guess the next holiday or busy for Filipinos is the Christmas. Christmas will be the next holiday for I guess not just for Philippines, but in Korea. There will be a Christmas also, right? 

speaker B
12:32
Yes, it is a big holiday. And again, I'm going to spend my time alone. 

speaker A
12:44
Maybe I can just invite you to come over here and celebrate Christmas. The way the family of my husband celebrates Christmas is really a big Christmas party. Like big. 

speaker B
13:01
Party? 

speaker A
13:02
Yeah, big party. A lot of games. Christmas games, competitions among families and relatives. There's a lot of foods. We exchange gifts. All of us should bring gifts. Because whatever you want to give, just bring a gift. And actually, every Christmas, we have a lot of bag of gifts to receive. 

speaker B
13:27
That must be with a lot of joy. Wow. 

speaker A
13:30
You should come visit Philippines during Christmas. Actually, last Christmas last year, the cousin of my husband has a foreigner friend. She joined us and she was so amazed with how Filipinos do Christmas parties and games. She was really like, wow, it's Filipinos. Really make family bunding through a Christmas party. 

speaker B
13:58
I hope I can go enjoy it. Is it okay to do classes on Monday and Wednesday? Because you might yeah.

speaker B
14:21
Not only mine, but also. 

speaker A
14:25

speaker B
14:44
