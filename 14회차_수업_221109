speaker A
00:02
Especially if the big tattoo is, like, weird and scary and. 

speaker B
00:11
They look strong when they got tattoos. And you know what? I have been there are some stickers you can just attach. 

speaker A
00:27
I think they call it artificial tattoos. It can just be like, after a week or two weeks, it can just be removed by itself. 

speaker B
00:38
And I had one because my ex girlfriend gave me a tattoo sticker. We call it tattoo of earth with iron mouse. And I actually had two tattoo stickers. One was here, which was banana. Banana with face, and one was baby here. It was the earth with blue earth. Yeah. With face, too. And you know what? At that time, I got so much confident that I got tattoos because in my body. 

speaker A
01:46
So you felt like you were superior. Like, there was a confidence when you. 

speaker B
01:52
Had the tattoo, even though it was banana with face. 

speaker A
01:59
Banana with a face. So you felt even though that was just a fake tattoo, you felt highness to yourself, like, oh, I have a tattoo. 

speaker B
02:10
Yeah. They're kind of I don't know. 

speaker A
02:13
Why do you consider that tattoo is a body art where people can express themselves through a tattoo? 

speaker B
02:24
Sure. One of my ex girlfriend was Tati. She gave people tattoo with color. 

speaker A
02:43
For free or for pay? 

speaker B
02:46
For paid. 

speaker A
02:50
Wow. Actually, I know tattoo with colors are more expensive. Actually, as I know, it depends on the size. And if you put color in it, the more you put color in it, the more it's expensive, the bigger the design you'll but it's more expensive. 

speaker B
03:11
But I feel kind of avoidance. Avoidance of getting tattooed. 

speaker A
03:31
Okay. Why? Like, the real tattoo, why is that? 

speaker B
03:35
Because it's so hard to liberate the process. 

speaker A
03:42
Like, if you wanted to get rid. 

speaker B
03:45
Of it, it is very hurtful and painful. I heard that. 

speaker A
03:53
Yeah. Well, that is what I know. If you want to remove your tattoo and your skin, the part of your skin will not be good looking anymore. 

speaker B
04:04
Yes. That makes me scared about getting tactic. The difficulty of reversing it. Remove it. 

speaker A
04:19
Yeah. That's the thing. Once you decide a tattoo, if you plan to get a tattoo, a person should really think it because think it over. Because it's not like a food that if you eat it and you don't like it, you can just throw it off or throw it out. But once a tattoo that's already on your skin. 

speaker B
04:46
To getting tattooed. 

speaker A
04:49
Yeah. On the process of that tattoo while making it because they're using needle. Yes. There's a pain, like a bite of an ant or like you can feel a little bit, like, if you will imagine it, like slice. Something is slicing your skin. But after the process, it's done. No pain left. After it's done on the process, there's really a pain because of the needle. Of course, before starting it, they will put the design first. They will draw the design and then they will do it. If you really can endure pain, it's not really the pain. The pain, I even have endured it. It's even here. This is more easier for me. This one, I felt pain, but the pain was tolerable after it was done, it's done. 

speaker A
05:53
And actually, tattoo artist can put an aesthesia cream on your skin, so that lesser pain. But after that, it's okay. On the process, there's really a pain, but it's not that really very painful. Thanks to the anesthesia cream that they also put the tattoo artist, my mom or my husband, he has tattoo both on her lower on his lower legs. Big tattoos. Dragon and Spider. And I think the other one is Dragon. 

speaker B
06:39
Dragon and Spider. Wow. 

speaker A
06:42
My mom on her lower leg. It was a very colorful flower, so it was a bit expensive. But I cannot endure a big design because of the pain. So I just had this one and not colorful, but actually, after I got the tattoo, I was actually trying to observe how will people react if they know I had a tattoo. How is the feeling? Actually, just nothing. They will know. Oh, you have a tattoo. That's great. That's it. 

speaker B
07:24
Is it common to having tattoo? 

speaker A
07:27
Is it common to have a tattoo? I guess so. Mostly the cousins of my husband have small tattoos. My mom, my sister, my brother in law have tattoos. I guess it's common for just small tattoo. Some people are putting it for a memory of a person like butterfly. For a person who left, some will put some names in memory of that person. So I can say it's a bit common, but I know somebody who is living the same town. But now she's living in America and she just got married. Actually, now she has tattoos here and here and here. She's a woman. I can't imagine the pain she's enduring during the process. 

speaker A
08:33
Okay, back to the topic. Where was that? The tattoo? Okay. One student said the tattoo is illegal in Korea. Is it true? 

speaker B
08:55
I don't know. Maybe not. Because half of the men who were trained with me were tattooed and maybe drink tattoo without certain certificate. Maybe illegal. Doing it is illegal. Argument. Not taking it. 

speaker A
09:24
Okay. They are already I'm sorry. A little bit noisy. A cousin of my husband is greeting my husband. A birthday. 

speaker B
09:37
TC is Wednesday. Wow. First thing? 

speaker A
09:41
Yeah, he's already awake. Actually, midnight, I surprised him with a little cake with a big candle. Yesterday is his birthday, so happy birthday to him. Okay, I will be sharing photos so that you later on tonight or afternoon, I will be sharing to you photos on how Filipinos celebrate birthdays. 

speaker B
10:11
Yes, thank you. 

speaker A
10:13
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow for another topic. Okay. 

speaker B
10:16
Yes. Bye. Have a great day. Have a great funny.
