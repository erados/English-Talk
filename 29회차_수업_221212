Hi, Red. 

speaker B
00:06
Hi. Good morning. It's a beautiful Monday morning and success. You I woke up. You woke up early. 

speaker A
00:25
I woke up at 610 and I went to the gym, I took a shower and now it's time. 

speaker B
00:40
Hopefully you really woke up early today. 

speaker A
00:42
Yes, I did. 

speaker B
00:46
What is your weekend? Nothing special. I think the cold weather really, I think usually can make you fall asleep more. Okay. So I think we're just going to have the article. 

speaker A
01:16
It's about some baskeeper cotton cream. 

speaker B
01:28
Yeah. Do you know her? 

speaker A
01:31
No, I do not know. 

speaker B
01:35
I think I've seen her in some just news Facebook feeds before for basketball. She's very tall. 

speaker A
01:49
Yes. 

speaker B
01:52
When you look at her, she seems to look like men. 

speaker A
01:56
Yes. I first thought. 

speaker B
02:00
She'S a man. 

speaker A
02:01
Yes. 

speaker B
02:04
I've seen her. I know. I have seen her through Facebook feeds because I know there is also a basketball for women. So I know, I have seen her. And she was prison for supposedly she was to go to prison for how many years? Nine years. 

speaker A
02:33
I forgot. 

speaker B
02:38
I think nine years for the marijuana? 

speaker A
02:43
Yes. 

speaker B
02:46
So in Russia, no drugs, unlike in America. America, obviously marijuana. There are other states that they already legalized marijuana. But she maybe she went to Russia back up some of this marijuana. But I wonder if she even did research on it. Just made me wonder is she aware that it's not allowed in Russia when it comes to drugs? 

speaker A
03:43
She had to to look at that. She had to do such research before she carried them. She carried the drugs to delocia because she should be caught like this. 

speaker B
04:11
But she says here she forgot like she forgot that I mean, she didn't notice that she included it in her luggage. So I think she's aware. What do you imagine would be the worst countries to be sent to prison? Or let's just say, what do you imagine the worst prison in the world? 

speaker A
04:40
Of course, north Korea and China. I think in North Korea people are having very hard time living. There are some places known for us in South Koreans where the people in North Korea go when they committed some criminals defined by the government. And the story is very harsh. There is a mine called Audi in North Korea, and we 

speaker A
05:48
heard that people in North Korea go there when they are sentenced to some labors as their punishment to take in there, they had to work and work and they have nothing to eat. So North Korea is the most fattest, the worst, the worst percent. Yes. The worst place to go when somebody come in. 

speaker B
06:39
Have you heard of alcatratras? 

speaker A
06:45
I think I have some. Is that some island? 

speaker B
06:49
Yes, island prison. Which part of the history where the worst criminal was descent there? 

speaker A
07:00
I seen that in a game. In a game? Yes. 

speaker B
07:10
But you haven't seen any documentaries about alcatraz? 

speaker A
07:14
Yes, I haven't. Have you? 

speaker B
07:17
I have, because out of curiosity and I have seen that Al Qataras movie and documents and it's creepy, it's scary, especially when you watch the real documentary and comparing it to the movie that you've seen. It's really match from the movie and the real documentary. It's scary imagining it. That island contains the worst criminals ever and you can never escape from that island because the sea is also like you cannot survive because of the strong park current and it's a deep sea and you cannot swim going to the next island because it's very far. I think now Al Qatar there will be people who wants to have a tour. 

speaker B
08:23
They can yeah, but it's so scary like some prison killed themselves there because you can never really go out from the island and I think no visitors allowed to. 

speaker A
08:45
Those visitors allowed to go there to meet those criminals. 

speaker B
08:52
Yeah, because they're the worst of the worst criminals. There is this thing that they say criminals put to prison are not really suffering, do you agree? 

speaker A
09:15
In some ways because there are so many people having trouble in making mirrors for themselves but the clean Miracy details are given to those mirrors that those who is outside literally wants to have and they are all made by those taxis paid by us. So it is somewhat unfair to do so. 

speaker B
10:09
Well, I guess it's because they are saying criminals are not suffering in depression because I think some prisons in other countries it's very beautiful. I think in America they have good what do you call that? Jail cells each have room, right? And they have clean bathroom, clean room, eating three meals a day, going out in the jail guard what is that? Ground exercise. Living life comfortably. I think that's what they say and that's what they are trying to explain. They might be suffering because they are far away from their family. I guess that's a factor. 

speaker A
11:01
I don't know much about Jersey, but maybe they're kind of good quote given to those politicians. Maybe. And I have heard about the jails in China and all the things that the criminals given is bought by their own money or their family's money. Even the bullet they get when they punish it is paid by death and I think that is light. 

speaker B
12:08
How strict is Korea's law against drugs? Do you have an idea? 

speaker A
12:17
I do not know the exact punishment they get when they do drugs but I think it is very strict in Korea to the drugs. There are some kind of delay in the punishment in this country. There is something called in this country that means that you are criminals and you have to pay the what do you call you 

speaker A
13:26
must pay for the cream crime you you've done. 

speaker B
13:35
Yeah, that's correct. You must pay for the crime you've committed. Consequence. You have to face the consequence of the crime you committed. 

speaker A
13:45
But there can be some kind of delay or some kind of delay to the punishment and it is called Japan Yue and I've never heard about Japan Yue done by those criminals to drug dealing or something. So it is very strict in this country. 

speaker B
14:14
So kind of like if you say this one here in the Philippines, I just don't watch television. So even in Facebook, I guess almost every day there is a report of a crime or a report of drug users caught by police or crimes related to drugs. So in Korea it's not really a common usual crime related to drugs? 

speaker A
14:42
Yes, it is, but these days it is more and more. 

speaker B
14:49
It'S not becoming. 

speaker A
14:50
Common, it is becoming I don't know how to call it born more. Yes. 

speaker B
15:04
So maybe there are already drugs got in Korea. 

speaker A
15:09
Yes. 

speaker B
15:13
Okay. But I'm sure Korea government or authorities will put an end to it so that it will not get worse. We also don't have enough much time. I already sent you an email article for tomorrow. Yes, I think that's related to exercise. Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow and have a great day. 

speaker A
15:35
See you tomorrow. Last bye.
