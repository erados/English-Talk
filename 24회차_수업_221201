Hi guys. 

speaker B
00:10
Morning. Please can you hear my husband snoring? Let's have some coffee. Okay. 

speaker A
00:28
What's going to be our topic today about protest? 

speaker B
00:37
Have we known about this issue? 

speaker A
00:39
Yes. Because in my university, there is a place where students can protest no, not protest can attach some large paper about their opinions. And there was paper about the protest. 

speaker B
01:11
Okay. Actually, I have noticed this issue even when it was not yet angled. I've seen this issue in my Facebook news feed, even in Korea Times Facebook page. Sorry, I've seen it, but I guess it's because I'm very busy. I didn't have the chance to click the article and read the details. But all I know is a protest. But I didn't understand yet what's going on is that their cases are going up again and Xi Jinping directed to do a lockdown. Something like that. So now I found out it's an anti locked down protest. They are against the lockdown directive by Xi Jinping. What are your thoughts about this directive? Orders of Si Jinping. Do you think it is rightful to do this lockdown? 

speaker A
02:22
Some stories about China's lockdown situation. I forgot the details, but those were so way more restrictive than I thought. I remember that they are suffering from lack of food, water, those kinds of things. It seems very light for me to protest against the 

speaker A
03:27
government for these reasons. Because they are about to die in the situation. They need food, they need water, they need environment that they can live with freedom. 

speaker B
03:52
Or I guess people are sick and tired of two years during the Pandemic, it was mostly of us people suffers from mostly lockdowns. But I guess during those years, we are prepared for our basic needs. I was thinking also maybe residents xi Jinping just directly said this order and people were not prepared to provide their foods or their basic needs, right? Well, for me, if a lockdown is really necessary, as long as the people are provided properly, of course that's very important. Because we're talking about lockdowns, we are making people in jail, right? We are to be taken care of. We are to be prevented to have a problem. But I hope really while deciding a lockdown basic needs is really important to be provided by the people, that's 

speaker B
05:04
really very important. Here in the Philippines, if a town is on lockdown, let's say during the Pandemic, let's say for example, my town or my community, there are covert cases, so everybody will be locked down. So every day there is no you will be given one sack of rice, everything that you need basic needs, milk, coffee, sugar, meats, rice that is really provided. And monitoring team will control each house if what they need. If you need some soy sauce or oil, there is somebody from the outside that will be assigned for that needs medicines like that. 

speaker A
05:54
Have you ever get the copy? 

speaker B
06:03
We know we had it, but we didn't go to the hospital to do a check, a coveted test, because it's different. Before the election, it was so different here because it's a dirty politics here. They are using Covet to make money cases. For example, even if you go to the hospital because of a different sickness, let's say you're a diabetic, you just go to the hospital for some complications. Then even if you're not covered, they will put you covered positive. Then you will be admitted to the hospital even if you're not Covet. So government that time here we're making money, corruption is happening, because I know about that, because my mom and my sister works for the government, so they know what's going on. I think I first got the COVID last year after a Christmas party that was held in a beach. 

speaker B
07:11
That time, all the symptoms, I had it. All the symptoms I know that was a Covet. I had some fever, and this year too, recently, five months ago, I guess, five months ago, me, my sister, the husband of my sister, all the symptoms again of the Omnicon, we had it. I even took absent because I was having really a high fever, my back pains, my headache, my throat, everything. And somebody record, even my students, a teacher, you have to go to the hospital for a proper coffee test. And I said, no, maybe if I am living in Korea and the test is proper, I will. 

speaker B
08:06
But my city, the kind of government we are having, it's impossible. 

speaker A
08:12
So you can get those supplies for those who are Covet. 

speaker B
08:24
We had the medicine for Covet because my mom is working for the government, so she has an access to the medicines for Covet. We know it was not a simple code or something that was already covered, because it even took almost two months to recover the full body strength we had. I know that I had a Covet two times. My husband, on my first Covet, he was infected because he lost his sense of smell and taste. Yeah. And also the auntie and uncle of my husband who positively got committed, were isolated. They also didn't go to the hospital because they don't trust the government here. So they just isolate themselves in their house in a mountainous area. 

speaker B
09:28
My husband also didn't come here because he was a close contact. So for one week, my husband didn't come home here. We don't allow him to come here to prevent the spread. 

speaker A
09:42
How is it going right now? Is the government change it? 

speaker B
09:50
Yeah, the government now has changed. It was changed from the election may, but the previous government, they were really very corrupt. Very, very corrupt. But now we can truly trust. Right now. I'm in covet. I can truly trust to go to the government hospital or any doctor that can test me if I'm in Covet or not. No bias, no lies. It will be truth before the election. It was really so bad. 

speaker A
10:31
I got copied too, in this year. When was that? January. And there were so many people who got the copy that there was a lack of people who works for authority of Paris. And there was a situation that the management for those who got covered was not successfully done. Because it is the reason why the Chinese government couldn't handle the people who are in 

speaker A
11:34
lockdown situation. And that leads to in my soul, that leads to the protest. 

speaker B
11:47
But I have a curious question now from you. I haven't heard your opinion about this. Do you think your government handled the COVID situation ever since it started? Let's base it from the time that the COVID 19 started. Do you think and are you satisfied with how your government handled the coverage situation? 

speaker A
12:12
There were some mistakes in some policies there, because our government had done it well for some months. But after that they just released some restrictions, was unheard. And that leads to some kind of explosion in the patient. 

speaker B
13:04
Of patients. The number of patients, it was increasing. It was skyrocketing. 

speaker A
13:13
Yeah, a lot. And that was a huge mistake the government took. But except that I satisfied actions the government took. 

speaker B
13:33
Actually, what I like about Korea, or I don't know with other countries yet, but so far during the pandemic, what I was looking forward to is the honest COVID testing. But so far I know Saudi Arabia too. They are very particular with COVID testing. If just colds or it's a covet. That's what I'm looking forward to. But I think in Korea, also in Korea, you will really be determined if it's covered or just a sickness. That's what I'm really looking forward to. But so far now it's okay to have a covet that so far in my city, thankfully, there's no covet. There might be covet cases, but it's very low. So people just go out, live normally. Some are still wearing face masks because I guess they got used to it for two years wearing too much. I guess you will get used to it already. But mostly people are living life normally, not the way it used to be before the coveted 19. 

speaker B
14:39
And we don't have enough time. I'll see you tomorrow. Don't go back to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. 

speaker A
14:51
Tomorrow, guys. 

speaker B
14:52
Bye.
