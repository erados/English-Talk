Hi, good morning. 

speaker B
00:03
Morning. Last. 

speaker A
00:06
I'm bad. Sorry for the delays of the classes. 

speaker B
00:16
I was late. 

speaker A
00:22
And the way it's important is I'm back now, back in a good condition. So. Thank God it's Friday. Actually all glasses yesterday I did nothing. I just stayed in the bed because of the connection. 

speaker B
00:44
Intern, did you find the reason why the connection was not good? Did you find the reason? 

speaker A
00:59
Usually it's here in the Philippines. Even if we were in the middle of the class, the weather is good or bad, just suddenly there's a blackout. Or worse is if the internet usually goes down suddenly many times, that's our greatest enemy here in the Philippines. And like in Korea, no matter what good or bad weather, your internet connection is very good. In the Philippines, when it comes to technology, we are really very bad. Actually, just a few days ago, one student also she has been a student for two years already. She keeps on experiencing actually the sudden blackouts. Or we are in the middle of the class, just we are cut off. I cannot really find an answer because I'm not good at electricity or something. 

speaker A
02:01
But it really happens. Not just here, but also in the province. The province is even the worst because it's really like brown out. Like blackout us here sometimes. Okay, internet is gone. We're going to wait for a few hours and then it's back again. And then we thought it's going to be stable and then it's cut off again. Yesterday also there were teachers who were not from my city. They were also from other provinces. They also lost their sudden power interruption too. So no power, no internet, no electricity. But actually on my part, lesser on me. Just that yesterday it's the internet server is lost. I have electricity. But the internet service provider really lost suddenly. 

speaker A
03:03
Because even if there will be a blackout here, I have a Ups like it's an emergency power supply that will give power to my internet router. So that already solved my problem. But my only enemy here is if the internet service provider will be lost. 

speaker B
03:36
Did it take whole day to recover? 

speaker A
03:40
No. Yesterday too, I decided to take an absent tool to everything to take a rest. Because I was not feeling well. So I think I just only did a class early morning, my first class at 06:00 A.m. And then the rest of the next students were absent. And then I think at 645, my internet was already like not stable. So I was thinking like, this will just be okay. And then it was already gone. I was in the middle of the class of an adult. So I was also not feeling well that time. So I just decided to just cancel everything really and took a rest yesterday and then just observing. Then the internet. So everything from last night, I already fully observed. 

speaker A
04:43
The internet is already okay. But don't worry. The class all classes yesterday were not counted. Because of course it's an absent. So now, no class perform. No, not counted. Yes. 

speaker B
05:04
You know what? I just woke up. 

speaker A
05:11
It's already 830 and Miu is not late. What happened? Did you slept again late? 

speaker B
05:26
I went to bed at 02:00 A.m.. What was I doing? I'm thinking about it. What did I do yesterday? I've been watching YouTube videos about managing time. Because these days I'm having problem at managing time. I don't know why, but. 

speaker A
06:18
Managing time do you make yourself busy the whole day? 

speaker B
06:26
I tried to, but it doesn't go well as I think. 

speaker A
06:38
It didn't go well? 

speaker B
06:40
Yeah, it didn't. 

speaker A
06:45
Because it's already like I was asking you if you are doing it, so you're doing it, but it didn't go well. I guess organizing and managing your time is your problem. How to do it? All right. 

speaker B
07:10
Yesterday, I tried to waste my time using an app called Timer. And I tried to record all the time I spent to analyze what I do with my time. But it didn't go well. 

speaker A
07:49
It didn't go well. How many times have you tried that app already? Just a few times. Maybe make it two weeks doing that app. Maybe it will just work then. 

speaker B
08:03
Just one day. 

speaker A
08:05
Just one day? 

speaker B
08:06
Yes. 

speaker A
08:07
Do it more days a week. No one failure. Don't give up. Try and try until maybe you can succeed. Do it well. You know what? That's also my problem. Before, when I started waking up early, it was hard. Because even if I do alarm clock, I just shut it down and go back to sleep. The reason that I have complaints before, because I committed to having classes early morning at 06:00 A.m.. So I alarmed my clock my alarm at 545. But I just shut it down and just go back to sleep. And then I just realized I have a class and then I am already late for 30 minutes and the student was complaining. It was hard. But I guess my motivation that time to be part of this kind of job was really strong. If you have a firm determination, I guess you can really organize and manage your time. 

speaker B
09:16
I think I have to go back. 

speaker A
09:22
Early. 

speaker B
09:23
Yeah, maybe eleven to midnight. I have to go back at that time because I need about 7 hours. 7 hours of sleep for life day. Nice condition. 

speaker A
09:53
Usually I think when we sleep early like last night after taking medicine, I think at around eleven or almost eleven, I'm already asleep. My daily routine Monday to Friday is almost 01:00 a.m. Asleep. So I slept early. Actually, at around 05:00 A.m., my alarm is not yet on. I was already awake. And then naturally I just soak up. Just oh, I thought it's the last time, it's still five. No, 430. I just suddenly wake up. Just naturally waking up. And I thought it's a class. I said, oh, it's still 430. I took a nap again. And then I just woke up again at around 05:00. So I think sleeping early will just make yourself naturally wake up, right? But if you're going to sleep like today, I'm back to work already back to class. 

speaker A
10:55
So expected, I'm going to sleep at almost 01:00 a.m. So the next day, it's going to be hard for me to wake up naturally. So I need an alarm clock. 

speaker B
11:04
It's very hard for me to reject the attention of YouTube. 

speaker A
11:16
Last night, I was in the bed just relaxing. I was just playing phone games. Like those mind games solving then it didn't make me fall asleep or feel sleepy. So I just took medicine. Because my blood pressure was up. Actually a little bit high. So that's why I was feeling dizziness and headache. So that's why I took arrest. Also yesterday, the whole day, at night, nothing. So I just took a rest. So the medicine helped me also to fall asleep. But anyways, we also don't have enough much time. I still have Alexa, so I'll see you then on Monday. 

speaker B
12:05
Okay, see you then. 

speaker A
12:07
Bye.
