speaker A
00:03
I'm gonna make a routine. 

speaker B
00:07
Yes. Hopefully your sleeping habits will change to a more better one, not excessively. Okay. What's going to be our topic for this morning? 

speaker A
00:24
You go one about aircraft. Airship. 

speaker B
00:30
The airship. After reading the article, what was on your mind? 

speaker A
00:38
I was thinking that where do the passengers will be in the airship? I thought about that. The picture at the title shows that the picture in the Arctic shows that the passengers will be at the bottom of the L shape. And I just thought about oh, then they cannot see the above. 

speaker B
01:27
Yeah, they cannot see above what's? Above the sky. And like an airplane, we can see from the window. We can see up and down. 

speaker A
01:39
They just can't see below. 

speaker B
01:44
Also, when I read this airship thing, the speed is slower than the regular speed of an airplane. So I was thinking that's why there's an airplane, because it's fast. Right. But this airship, I mean, I just don't get the purpose of it, why it was there before. The speed is slow. And then the positive thing is maybe because in a plane, it's not spacious. Right. We barely can move once we sit down on a plane. Right. I was thinking, is this airship a little bit spacious? Because it's really huge, right? 

speaker A
02:34
Yes. You did choose. 

speaker B
02:40
Do you think this airship operated before and it just stopped when there was an incident, when it killed? I think 36 or 37 people. Do you think there is a possibility that this airship will have a comeback? 

speaker A
03:01
Possibilities. There might be some news to experience while others don't. There are people or me. There are people who want to experience a lot of things. And they might include light on the airship. I think so. There will be some leads. There will be some consumers who want to light on that. Whenever there is some needs and money, there will be the supplies too. So I think there is possibilities that airships can come back. 

speaker B
04:04
Okay. Well, the airship just travel domestically, just like public transportation, but in the air, right? Yeah, the airship is just for public, like just within your country, not going outside. Because I guess it's because of the speed of this, because they are just using helium to power up. I guess mostly the airship helium, which is very rare. How do you call that substance? How do you call an element or substance that's very rare? It's really big. Like a big dolphin in the air. Looking at the picture, like the first picture in the front, it's like a big white dolphin. 

speaker B
05:05
Dolphin. The first picture on the article. Really? It's like you're looking at the big white dolphin. 

speaker A
05:18
I just thought of about the price would be somewhat high, higher than I thought before. 

speaker B
05:29
Maybe higher than a regular domestic flight rate. 

speaker A
05:35
Higher than what I thought before. Because the size is better, massive. And there should be some places that the airships can land only. So I just thought about the price and that would be high. 

speaker B
06:08
When was the last time you were on a plane? 

speaker A
06:11
Plane? 

speaker B
06:13
What was the last time you had a flight and where were you going that time? 

speaker A
06:23
Philippines. 

speaker B
06:27
That was what, 10 hours flight? 

speaker A
06:36
It is about eight years ago and I cannot remember that much about it, but maybe less than 10 hours, maybe five, six. 

speaker B
06:53
Do you usually talk to the person sitting next to you on a plane? 

speaker A
06:59
I wasn't. I just recently tried to make conversation with the people around me who happen to be around me. And when I was young, three to four years ago, I didn't do that. I wasn't that talkative. 

speaker B
07:30
Also, you're saying that now you really approach and make friends with them and have a conversation. 

speaker A
07:37
Yes, I do. I try to. 

speaker B
07:42
Because mostly when I ask no, they don't. They don't want to. They don't and they don't want to. But you are different. You make friends and have a conversation. And so far, no bad experience. 

speaker A
07:59
So far, yes. I just looked at his or her face or some mood of him or her and I just filter who seems to not compatible with me so far, no bad experience at all. 

speaker B
08:36
Okay. 

speaker A
08:38
But there is some times that I just be rejected. 

speaker B
08:46
How are you rejected? Which makes sense. I wonder. How is it I can't imagine like what they try to approach and they just ignore you, like as if they don't hear anything? 

speaker A
08:58
No, not that kind of thing. But they just don't want to talk or ask me something. When I ask people about just things that we do at the moment together, because I usually meet people in some kind of conference or something and I just ask people around me about the things we are doing right now. But when I ask, they answers me. But they don't ask me about anything else. They just answer me. 

speaker B
09:52
They just answer your question, but don't really exchange conversation? 

speaker A
09:57
Yes, I feel a kind of rejection. 

speaker B
10:06
There are really people like that just answer when they are asked and they don't feel having a conversation. So in that way, just distance yourself from them. What was your annoying flight experience on a plane? 

speaker A
10:29
As you talked before? 

speaker B
10:33
As you said before. 

speaker A
10:35
As you said before, the airplane is not that space you like. It is you have to just compact it in a place you assigned. And when the person in front of me tried to lean his or her seat back, it is so narrow. 

speaker B
11:33
Especially if they put their seats like that, then it's going to be more narrower from you. Limited space. 

speaker A
11:39
Yes, that's one kind of annoying is when I feel at flames. 

speaker B
11:55
How about sometimes there are kids on the plane, right? Haven't you experienced annoying things on the plane? 

speaker A
12:06
Fortunately not. Maybe just because I have not that much experience on the sky. I have light airplane for three times and there wasn't baby or how do they create mischief? 

speaker B
12:48
Mischief. 

speaker A
12:49
Mischief. 

speaker B
12:59
Mischief. 

speaker A
13:00
Mischief. Mischief. I haven't met. 

speaker B
13:06
Okay. Well, mostly there's really not a lot of kids on a plane usually. So the number one thing annoying in an airplane is really the space. Once you sit down there, it's very uncomfortable. 

speaker A
13:24
Uncomfortable. 

speaker B
13:30
Among your planes from before and now, what was the most or let's just say best airline services you had? 

speaker A
13:43
Korean air, I think. 

speaker B
13:47
Why is that? 

speaker A
13:51
How do you call the people in the airplane? Who? 

speaker B
13:57
Flight crew. 

speaker A
13:58
Yes. Flight crews are beautiful. 

speaker B
14:04
Oh no. I thought you were going to say flight crew services are good answer. Very good. 

speaker A
14:20
Very happy pride. 

speaker B
14:28
Anyway, if you don't have enough much, then let's continue this tomorrow. Okay.
