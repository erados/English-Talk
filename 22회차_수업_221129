11:00, they were like, oh, you continue watching. They were so noisy. So I guess among all my students is you. I know two of you. The other one was last night. The last student, she didn't watch it. Like she just knew it was the story because when and she arrived home, the house was noisy because of cheering and shouting. And she just saw it quickly, like, oh, that's the score, blah, blah, blah. But she didn't watch really the entire game. She's not interested. So two of my students, you and the other one is not interested. 

speaker B
00:43
Very kind of family culture, because no one in my family is interested in sports. 

speaker A
01:03
Anyways, with our article for this morning. 

speaker B
01:07
About cooking eggs in different ways. 

speaker A
01:13
Cooking eggs in different ways. Okay. Do you like eating eggs? And if so, how do you like to have them? 

speaker B
01:28
I usually cook in a way that I do because it is easy and I love the learning part of Yellow York. I almost always eat it with rice. 

speaker A
01:58
Yeah, of course. Do you usually have the eggs for breakfast? What's, lunch or dinner? 

speaker B
02:05
Anytime. Anytime when I want to. And I usually mix the mix the eggs and rice together. 

speaker A
02:23
You mean to say sunnyside up and mixing it everyday? 

speaker B
02:27
Yeah, mixing it. 

speaker A
02:33
Like a fried rice. 

speaker B
02:36
Yes. But with LONGi yolks. 

speaker A
02:45
Yeah, the yolks are still raw, right. 

speaker B
02:51
And I put some soy sauce on it then. Ketchup Stewart Venue in Korea everybody who is living alone on her own would have cooked it. Yeah. 

speaker A
03:33
I prefer I rarely I eat eggs, but I guess once or twice a month, usually for breakfast, like the sunny side up, but usually for breakfast, eating boiled eggs sometimes makes me throw up. So if I will eat boiled egg, it's like half of one boiled egg. But mostly my favorite thing about egg is sunnyside up or the scramble deck. Scramble deck. 

speaker B
04:11
I loved the scramble deck when I was young, but there is a story that I loved eating it, and I used to ask my sister to cook it for me. But when I visited the USA, the hotel gives me scrambled eggs for every morning breakfast. And I just got sick of it at the time because there was nothing to eat other than scrambled 

speaker B
05:18
egg. And it is very four days, five days in a low way. 

speaker A
05:29
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking sometimes the feeling of having eggs every day, it's annoying and I don't know, for me, annoying and makes me throw up. Yeah, maybe let's just say another type of cooking of egg. Maybe it works like scramble egg today, pair it with bacon the next day, another style of cooking of egg. There should be something, a surprise. But eating the same type of cooking of egg, I guess it's annoying and making me throw up. So a little mixture with the egg. If a person is breakfast, because here in the Philippines, usually eggs is served breakfast especially for kids, actually with hot dogs or ham. 

speaker B
06:22
Hot dogs. 

speaker A
06:24
Hot dogs or eggs? Hot dogs, ham or bacon. That's usually the breakfast eggs is always there mostly adults here in the Philippines, a hot cup of coffee and a hot bed is already okay. But my father in law, because in our refrigerator there is always one tray of eggs, 30 pieces of eggs. I think he's always mostly having eggs every day. I don't know how he cooks it, but when I wake up in the morning, 06:00 A.m., he's also awake having breakfast. And I can just smell his cooking egg. But I'm not sure what type of cooking of eggs he is doing. 

speaker B
07:16
Wow. 

speaker A
07:20
How can he refrigerate? 

speaker B
07:29
How? 

speaker A
07:29
You don't know that because the kitchen, when I wake up, the kitchen is over there and then the living room, where the living room in the morning is here. So I don't usually go in the kitchen. Usually my routine here is room and then early morning I make the class outside in the living room because my husband does the student I have at 06:00 A.m. Is very sensitive to noise and I can't stop my husband's, nooring. So I just go out. So my father in law cooks either hot dogs. I can just know the smell, because a smell of a hot dog is very familiar to me. A smell of a neck is very familiar to me. So I don't really like look at oh, what's your cooking? No, I don't. But all I know, he's cooking an egg because the smell and of course, in the refrigerator there is always 30 pieces of eggs. 

speaker B
08:36
And every day it reduced. 

speaker A
08:40
Pardon? 

speaker B
08:41
Every day it's reducing. 

speaker A
08:48
I think one or two eggs he do in a day. Mostly every day he do the egg, sometimes spare it with hot dog. And then if the eggs what I noticed, if the eggs are just five pieces or ten pieces, he will buy again another 30 pieces. So the eggs in the refrigerators are not consuming, are not gone. It's always there anyways. What is your favorite breakfast, if you want to, aside from eggs? 

speaker B
09:26
Actually, about two years ago I was in Dom Torian. I didn't have to cook for me myself. 

speaker A
09:39
I didn't have to cook for myself. 

speaker B
09:42
Yes, I didn't have to cook for myself. And I just take what I served. And at the time, every day I ate breakfast. But after I get moved to a house where I live alone, I found it. It is very hard to cook for myself and I usually skipped it. So it is so long to remember what I like to prefer. 

speaker A
10:35
People say, experts say, doctors say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But can you tell me what are some or few of the reasons why people skip breakfast, knowing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day? 

speaker B
10:55
Jose sleep more than me. 

speaker A
11:04
And other else. 

speaker B
11:06
You don't have to prepare for sleep. You just lay down on the bed and close your eyes and it is all but to get some meal you have to cook, you have to take some dishes and you have to think about luxury today. 

speaker A
11:33
And also people are also very busy to cook too. Let us sleepy people need more to sleep. Or people are so busy to prepare breakfast. Maybe they will have breakfast but usually they just go to the office and have coffee. Busy people. Okay, you cook, right? If you rate your cooking skills from zero to ten, yes. If you rate your cooking skills from zero to ten. 

speaker B
12:15
Three. I just started cooking and it seems to me that there is so much things I had to know I didn't do yet, I didn't cook yet, those kind of things. Especially recently I noticed that it is very hard to cook with stainless pants. And I thought that cooking is a kind of a world that where I fight with those tennis fans. 

speaker A
13:10
We don't also have enough time. I'll see you tomorrow. Don't go back to bed anymore. 

speaker B
13:18
Well, I don't know. 

speaker A
13:21
Don't go back to bed. Get up. Get up. Get up. 

speaker B
13:25
Tomorrow. Bye.
