A bit late, I think. Me? I slept around. Actually, I was already in the bed. Because I arrived home yesterday at around six or 07:00 p.m. After making sure everything is okay yesterday. So I was already in the bed at around 09:00 p.m.. Because I just want to take a rest early. Because I have started work again supposedly yesterday. But I can't sleep even though I was tired. So I was just trying to watch Korean drama. I think I slept around. I think that was around 11:00 p.m.. I was expecting to sleep early last night, but cannot. And it was a sad weekend for Korea, right? 

speaker B
00:51
It was. Actually. 

speaker A
01:04
When did you find out about the accident? The following day or the night? 

speaker B
01:10
Tonight. Because early internet in Korea was just talking about the accident at that night. 

speaker A
01:22
Oh, is it the one near your place? 

speaker B
01:28
Ethioon? Yeah, about half minutes by survey. 

speaker A
01:36
Oh, so it's just. 

speaker B
01:41
Half hour. 

speaker A
01:43
When was the last time you went to iteone? 

speaker B
01:46
ITE one there is a museum called Liam Museum which is built by Igoni who is the CEO of Samsung. So I went to the museum early this year. Maybe January or February after that, I haven't been. 

speaker A
02:19
When was the last time you partied your party? 

speaker B
02:23
Party? 

speaker A
02:25
Party? You attended a party? Any party. 

speaker B
02:35
I don't like the loud mood of the party. 

speaker A
02:45
You don't like overcrowded place? 

speaker B
02:48
Overcrowded place? I'm not the kind of person who likes the parties or going to the clubs. Parties. Actually, I don't know. We Koreans do not do party as much as Western people. 

speaker A
03:26
People in that area who attended that Halloween party or the early 20s. So they are the generation Z who are very even me at my age during that time, I am so excited. Where is the enjoyment? Where is the overcrowded? Because the usual victims in the Edduon incident were early 20s, right? But for you, you have already read the stories and events, how it started, how it is. What do you think is to blame for what happened? 

speaker B
04:09
Whom to blame? 

speaker A
04:14
Do you think somebody should be responsible for what happened? 

speaker B
04:27
Well, I heard that there were people who started to push the people in prone of them. The people to blame? 

speaker A
04:52
The people who are pushing and pushing were to be blamed? 

speaker B
04:56
Yes. Was some kind of accident actually not another unintended kind of thing. Even though the guys who push it were to be blamed. But I believe that they didn't mean to do such. They didn't expect it such legit. 

speaker A
05:59
But what about the police? Police? They received phone calls from six, around six, but they didn't respond. Maybe if they could have responded from the phone calls, maybe it could have been prevented. Have you seen that? Young Song police station was raided by the investigation team and they found out about these phone calls at around six people. They were already recorded phone calls that they were asking for help from the police. But police answered at around 910, didn't make any action at around ten, it's the time the police went there, but it's already too late. 

speaker B
07:00
There were also officers who were arrived and did some CPR and try to help the people. There were also the kind of officers too. And I don't know if this word is exact expression, but I skimmed the article written by police officer and that says it's not that easy to say that the people is to be blamed, the officers is to be blamed police officers. Because there are so many phone calls they have to receive. 

speaker B
08:03
And not only them, but maybe I have to read that article again. 

speaker A
08:19
Because actually even online there's no how many days have been passed, right? But actually I just read articles from my Facebook because stories from what happened still in social media. Investigating investigation is ongoing. Police stations around that place were raided by the special investigation team. And really finding out what went wrong. What went wrong in the situation. Some are even saying at the early time, maybe around four or five, nobody, no police. Is it really that no police notice that the place is starting to be crowded? They could have monitored or controlled that the place is starting to overcrowded. So it could have prevented something like that. 

speaker A
09:20
There are a lot of situations that should be answered, I guess by the people who are questioning. The number one there is that is the early, like around four or five, the entrance of that alley or that event, were there no police who were controlling the people, the number of people coming in, something like that. But I hope this investigation will come out for an answer to the people who are asking for what's going on. What happened? That's really the question now. What happened? 

speaker B
10:01
Yes, prevent the next accident. 

speaker A
10:06
Exactly. Anyways, I don't have enough much time, but tomorrow I will call you five minutes earlier to make it up my late time today. 

speaker B
10:15
Okay, I'm late. Too late. 

speaker A
10:20
So I will call you five minutes earlier tomorrow. Okay? Okay, bye.
