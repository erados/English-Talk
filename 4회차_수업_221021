Morning guys. 

speaker B
00:26
Good morning. It's a beautiful Friday morning. 

speaker A
00:31
Friday. 

speaker B
00:34
That's going to be your plan for the weekend. 

speaker A
00:48
There is a site called GitHub where I cannot usually about program the code I load. So I'm going to upload some projects and course I have done in my university course. 

speaker B
01:20
You mean to say during your projects that you achieved during your school years? 

speaker A
01:26
In my school years. Some of them is my toy projects. 

speaker B
01:35
And the others some of them are. 

speaker A
01:37
Some of them are my toy projects and the others are some kind of October. 

speaker B
01:57
And what is the purpose of uploading your projects? Achieve projects in their website? 

speaker A
02:06
The purpose is to show what I have done so far. 

speaker B
02:42
Just to really show them no work related or finding a job related issue. Just to upload and let the people see what you've done. 

speaker A
02:55
Some of my purposes to appear to people who has permission to hire. 

speaker B
03:19
So kind of like this website, there are really potential employers or potential connections that will lead you to have a job? 

speaker A
03:32
Yes. And I'm going to share the link to the site. I'm going to download the link to the site everywhere I can upload the link. 

speaker B
03:53
So kind of like in that website millions of people are in there? 

speaker A
03:59
Yeah, there are millions, maybe more than that. Because this site is so famous that if you are a programmer, you cannot do your work without the site. You have to use the site. So maybe a billion people. 

speaker B
04:25
Oh, that's a good thing. You can showcase what you've got. You can showcase what you've done. Okay. I'm curious, how many achievements have you done so far? 

speaker A
04:51
Thought that there will be not that much of achievement during my school years, but there were some kind of things I have done so far more than I thought. I made some kind of small night divisions as my project. Night vision things and night vision camera. 

speaker B
05:31
You mean to say that even if it's a dark one night visions like even if it's dark it can capture things clearly? 

speaker A
05:39
Yes, as I major in electrical engineering and there are many others too. 

speaker B
05:52
What was your best project? 

speaker A
05:54
My best project? Actually I'm doing the project right now. The title is tracking simulation where with the algorithm you can check the position of each note without with distance information. It's kind of hard thing to understand. I had a hard time understanding it. It's kind of way smaller GPS system. 

speaker B
06:42
So it's a tracker. 

speaker A
06:44
Tracker? Yeah. You can find a position of some certain notes with information. 

speaker B
06:58
In all of these projects you have proven and tested it. Right. 

speaker A
07:04
I have to. 

speaker B
07:07
Not yet prevent tested. So you have to prevent tested yet. 

speaker A
07:19
Actually I made one but I have to optimize it. I haven't optimized it yet, so that's kind of things I have to do right now. 

speaker B
07:38
I think that would also that would help you. I guess because those are your projects. So that will help you enjoy your resting days before going on to another job. And it will give you time to prove your project. Let's just say you're are you planning to do another project? Another one? New one? 

speaker A
08:17
Actually, I have no idea right now what to do next. Maybe first I had to get hired, get a job first and then some kind of idea will come up in your mind. 

speaker B
08:51
Okay, well anyways, whatever your weekend will be, just enjoy and relax and always stay safe. Okay. 

speaker A
09:03
Thank you. 

speaker B
09:04
Okay. Did you happen to read any of the articles I sent you? 

speaker A
09:12
I had one with totally problem, but not the prisoners, not the whole article. 

speaker B
09:23
Not the whole article. Well, here comes the sense which would you choose? Saving five people or saving one person. 

speaker A
09:39
Till today morning, maybe 08:00 a.m. I don't know the word kumina DA. I think and think and think. What is light? What do you call it? What do you call the word kumina DA? I think. 

speaker B
10:03
You haven't decided yet. Decision making or something like that. 

speaker A
10:07
No, I have decided, but in a hard way. After a long time of thought, what do you call it? 

speaker B
10:29
Maybe a long time of thinking. 

speaker A
10:31
Being agony. 

speaker B
10:33
Ago thinking. 

speaker A
10:35
Yeah, ago thinking. And I decided not to get involved in the situation, not do anything because I don't have like whether a person should die or not. That's not mine. 

speaker B
10:54
Of course, nobody wants to die. Nobody wants people to die. But it's kind of like this. You're in a sinking boat, who are you going to save? Your wife or your parents? That is just the truly problem to simplify. You're in a sinking ship, you're a sinking boat. Who are you going to save? Your wife or your parents? 

speaker A
11:20
Am I in the sinking for two? 

speaker B
11:23
Yeah, you're in the boat already. You're in a safer one, but your parents and your wife are drowning. Who would you save? 

speaker A
11:34
Actually, I'm going to save both, save all of them and I will dive into the ocean. 

speaker B
11:42
But you don't have any much time. For sure. 

speaker A
11:46
There is kind of answer in that question that's not like truly problem, because I can meet another one, another girlfriend, but I have only one parent. So there is answer. 

speaker B
12:08
So in the trolley dilemma of five people against one person, that is also you're going to be thinking what if that one person is the greatest doctor in the world and saves a lot of lives? Contradict to this five person who are regular person. But what if these five people have families? That made my mind crazy too. So that kind of dilemma, kind of like I have to choose even until now. I already gave you the article. In a sinking boat, of course we can have the answer. But in the kind of trolley dilemma, five against one. 

speaker A
12:49
Although I decide to choose any kind of action in that situation. But if I got shortage of time in case that I'm driving a car and there are some problems in my car, in front of me, a person lying down, and in my light, there are five people. And maybe I chose to go straight because I have no time to think. I have to think very fast. And there are one person and five person. 

speaker B
13:46
That's the thing. It's kind of like the train is approaching and you should do something who to save? Time is ticking, time is gold. You have to think quickly. 

speaker A
13:59
If I have no time to think, I will just to kill people. 

speaker B
14:13
Five people. It's kind of like lesser damage, contradict to choosing one person. It's really hard. If only we can save both of the other side. And why not? But there are sometimes kind of like decision making. When we try to decide, there are things that we should take consideration. Right? If this decision A will be really good for us. If this decision B will really be good for us. So decision making sometimes is really tough. 

speaker A
14:47
And what is your decision? What do you do in that situation? 

speaker B
14:55
I would decide five people to save. 

speaker A
14:58
Decide five people? 

speaker B
14:59
Even though let's just say even if that one person is the president or the good person, but I'd rather save the five people. It's a great number. 

speaker A
15:10
Yes. 

speaker B
15:13
Thank you for your opinion, but we don't have enough much time. Let's continue on Monday, okay? 

speaker A
15:20
Yeah, 15 minutes is minitar. Yeah, too short to talk? 

speaker B
15:27
Okay, I'll see you Monday. Bye.
