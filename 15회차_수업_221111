speaker A
00:00
Morning. Man. 

speaker B
00:02
Good morning. Thank God it's Friday. So, yeah, I'm back. Okay. So thank God. This Friday was going to be our topic for this morning. 

speaker A
00:24
Wait a second. It is about friends. 

speaker B
00:41
I think our friends may appreciate contact more than we think. 

speaker A
00:50
Yes. 

speaker B
00:52
Do you have a certain friend whom maybe your friend is living in another country? Or you have a friend that you haven't had a communication since? 

speaker A
01:15
Having communications since? 

speaker B
01:18
Maybe that friend of yours, the last time you heard from him was high school or college. And that was a good friend of yours? 

speaker A
01:32
Actually, a lot. Because I actually don't send a message first for my high school friends or middle school friends. 

speaker B
02:15
Usually you are not the one who starts the conversation. 

speaker A
02:20
Yes, I try to change my stance. I don't know. 

speaker B
02:34
You try to change your approach. But I think naturally, it's not just your personality to send message at first. 

speaker A
02:45
Exactly. 

speaker B
02:47
Okay. There are really people who even me, I am not the type of person also like really here, or if I'm not doing job, actually, I'm a silent type of person. You can just see me sitting down or even when I'm with family, except if I'm drunk. But naturally, if I'm not doing any work, I'm just in the bed watching Korean drama. Or even with family, you can just see me there sitting down. But I'm not also the one who starts a conversation. Even text message. 

speaker A
03:26
There is a kind of text called MBTI. Maybe you heard about the correct I did that. You did? 

speaker B
03:36
But I just forgot my result. That was a long time ago. It was also my students who encouraged me like, Teacher, what's your result? Oh, I didn't do it the next day. Teacher, what's the result? I forgot. So finally I did it before. I just forgot the result. What was your MBTI? 

speaker A
03:58
Mine was INFP, which is introvert and emotional and don't have that strict kind of strict plan. I don't know. 

speaker B
04:28
Mine was I remember there was an A on my MBTI. 

speaker A
04:35
A? 

speaker B
04:38
There was really an A from that MBTI I have yeah, I can remember. But that MBTI even until now. I guess a few months ago, it was really very famous. But is it until now, it's really famous in Korea? Like, when you get to know a person, do you mostly ask what's your MBTI? 

speaker A
05:03
Yes. In. Last Saturday, I visited a conference called GDSC, which stands for Google Developer Student Club Conference. And there was a person I met in there. And when we talked together, she asked me, what is your MBTI? And I turned her mine. 

speaker B
05:46
Okay. After telling the MBTI, does it mean that it's kind of like comparing his MBTI to yours? Right? So the purpose of getting to know MBTI, is it to know your personality? Or is it the basis to make friends or not with you? 

speaker A
06:09
Basis? 

speaker B
06:10
I mean, asking each MBTI, let's say for example, you ask my MBTI and ask your MBTI. What is the purpose of that for Koreans, is it also just to get the person better or that is a basis if making friends with this person is good or not. 

speaker A
06:34
Maybe just for starting a talk or getting information about the person. As you said, to know whether this person is a good match or not with me. 

speaker B
07:03
Okay, so I should have inquiry when I arrived, so I should expect what's your MBTI? I should do the MBTI first before arriving in Korea. 

speaker A
07:17
Famous. 

speaker B
07:19
Okay. Do you have any friends you would like to get back in touch with? 

speaker A
07:34
I'm introverted, but at the same time, I like having friends. Whenever I visit conference or seminar, I try to make friends by easily starting to talk to the person next to me. 

speaker B
08:06
And. 

speaker A
08:09
When I was in the university, I met at least a man. A guy as my friend sat next to me in the class. 

speaker B
08:39
Who are. 

speaker A
08:40
Sat next to me at least one in a semester. I like making friends and I like how they call it contact with. 

speaker B
09:05
You'd like to have a contact with them? 

speaker A
09:08
Yes, keep contact with them. 

speaker B
09:10
Keep a contact with them. Do you have certain classmates or friends from high school or college that until now you remained a communication? 

speaker A
09:24
Yes. One of my mom, my friend, one of my friends in high school is going to graduate the same school, same university I was in. Actually, we are going to meet each other next week. I think it is Monday next week. 

speaker B
10:13
You're going to meet him next week? 

speaker A
10:16
I'm gonna meet him in the university. We are going to graduate. 

speaker B
10:24
Okay, hold on. Do you have, I guess mostly have what we call as close friend or best friends. Do you have one or two best friends or close friends? Since even though you're an introvert person, but do you have a so called best friend? 

speaker A
10:54
I think not. Whenever I was asked about do you have any best friends? I cannot help thinking about or did I think someone as my best friend? What if she or he doesn't think as I think? So I have hard time thinking, no, someone has my best friend. 

speaker B
11:52
If you have a best friend, it's making you thinking hard because do you think being introvert is one of the reason why you don't have the so called close friend or best friends? 

speaker A
12:03
No, I don't think because at the same time, introvert some kind of extrovert as I start talking with someone next to me. Actually, yesterday event, what was it? Engineering festival. 

speaker B
12:51
In school? 

speaker A
12:52
Yes. And I was going there alone without my friends. But I try to make one as my friends even though I happened not to visit there in the room where the people going there were in about is there someone I can go there with? Do you understand? There was a person actually. But I didn't go there. 

speaker B
13:55
Okay? 

speaker A
13:57
Because there was actually a big event of me which is I got certified some kind of police prosecution service. 

speaker B
14:19
Prosecution? 

speaker A
14:30
See, this is what is that? 

speaker B
14:46
What is that? 

speaker A
14:48
Warrant. 

speaker B
14:50
A warrant? What warrant? For you? 

speaker A
14:57
Yes, how do call it? 

speaker B
15:16
By what? 

speaker A
15:20
My ex company. 

speaker B
15:23
For what? 

speaker A
15:38
For leaking. That is secret information. 

speaker B
15:47
So leaking one of your previous company right, so one of my previous company sued a case or filed a case against me. Against me for leaking. How could they call that confidential? A confidential information? 

speaker A
16:24
Yes, exactly. So I couldn't visit the engineering festival where I tried to make friends. 

speaker B
16:40
Okay, so you missed that event and. 

speaker A
16:50
They took my cell phone and this is my ex cell phone. 

speaker B
17:01
That was what they confiscated from you. 

speaker A
17:04
And they copied all my information in my laptop to see. 

speaker B
17:13
And did they prove anything? 

speaker A
17:16
Not yet. Because it takes a long time to search the information my devices, maybe one of them said that it takes about three to four months to examine the information and to get the result of. 

speaker B
17:51
Her. 

speaker A
17:56
Suitcase, it might take a year. So it is long long. 

speaker B
18:10
It's a long process before really a proper case will be served to you. So on that warrant of arrest, your devices were confiscated. Copy the files and then wait for how many months to prove it if you did a leaking of information? 

speaker A
18:30
Yes, but they will get my cell phone as soon as they copy one and that is maybe today afternoon 06:00 p.m. Around 06:00 p.m., they will be back. They will copy the information of my cell phone and. 

speaker B
19:02
Everything you have in your phone. They can get information? 

speaker A
19:06
Yes, they will. 

speaker B
19:08
Is that even okay? Because that's already some part of that are private for you. 

speaker A
19:20
Actually, the process should have been ended. 

speaker B
19:30
The process should have ended when? 

speaker A
19:43
At the day when I was searching. But the airport I used was very recent one and the device got updated a lot, maybe ten days ago. So they couldn't copy my information from my cell phone at the place. So that's the reason they took it. And I have to wait. 

speaker B
20:12
Why did your company suspect you of leaking information? Just curious. 

speaker A
20:29
Because my ex girlfriend no, not perfect ex company ex company workers. Company workers were or the workers were in my Xx company and the CEO of my X company was CTO of myxx company tested it. 

speaker B
21:06
So you mean to say even your coworkers are also pushing it, pointing it out to you? 

speaker A
21:12
No, they also suited. 

speaker B
21:19
Oh really? 

speaker A
21:20
Yeah. So many people. 

speaker B
21:28
So not just you? 

speaker A
21:30
Yeah, it is six. 

speaker B
21:34
Oh my God. But I am just curious now since that is the thing suing cases, filing cases against you and other coworkers of yours, what if they prove it wrong? Should they compensate you for all those disturbances and even getting private information from your phone I mean disturbing your time. Your time was wasted because of what they are doing. Especially your phone's privacy are revealed because they need to get copies. Because they are suspecting you. If they prove it wrong, should they compensate you for disturbing your time? 

speaker A
22:32
Maybe not. Hurt the body? Heard about the compensation? Maybe not. 

speaker B
22:56
When you are with your friends, what do you usually do together with your friends when you are together with them? 

speaker A
23:10
Eat and drink. 

speaker B
23:12
Eat and drink. What is the favorite spot in Korea for friends to get together with? 

speaker A
23:26
Famous spot. There are three spots famous for getting along with friends. Usually nearby universities. There is a university called University University. The street nearby. They are very popular. 

speaker B
24:14
Maybe just like outside the university, there are small stores, cafes or cafeteria where they can just hang out. 

speaker A
24:23
There also bars and clubs. Or that I don't go there. 

speaker B
24:33
So cafes are the number one spot for friends to hang out and meet up and hang out. And then bars. What is that? Drinking bars. 

speaker A
24:45
Drinking bars. People in Korea love drinking, so they usually go eat and drink. Actually, no. On November 19, I'm going to be my university ten of University France. No. Ten University, France. And we are going to eat and drink. Nearby the university, we graduate. 

speaker B
25:31
So like there's a near drinking bar with foods. 

speaker A
25:34
All right. Yeah. 

speaker B
25:37
What do you usually drink with your friends? Is it the sujo or the beer? 

speaker A
25:42
I prefer beer. I'm not the soldier person. 

speaker B
25:49
Because it's also strong. 

speaker A
25:51
I'm not drinking. 

speaker B
25:56
Well, it's just chill. Well, usually that's really how friends nowadays mostly, let's just say 80%. When friends get together, it's always the food and drinks. That's really the common thing that they usually have. I think it's either wherever they meet up, there will always be food. There might be drinks. Some are just having some juice or tea. Some are having drinks like beer or alcohol. 

speaker A
26:23
And on the birthday too. 

speaker B
26:29
Well, here's the good spot. Here. It's also the same. Here. Friends meet up in the city. Like it's either they will meet up at a fast food parks. Cafe will always be number one meeting place for friends. 

speaker A
26:48
And now I think that we go together to an exhibition. My ex girlfriend was major in art. Many of my friends loves going to the exhibition. And BGM. 

speaker B
27:19
Are good places. We don't have enough much time. Thank you for the 30 minutes today, Miongu. Okay, already send you your class notes for today's class. If you have any questions, just free to message me anytime, okay? 

speaker A
27:39
