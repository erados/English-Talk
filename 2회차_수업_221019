speaker A
00:00
And one, the person was a man and the other person is the other colleague is girl who is 22 years old and she got no problem to be okay. 

speaker B
00:30
But it's your boss who is making a problem. Creating a problem. Yesterday, you just right away resigned. 

speaker A
00:46
Right away? 

speaker B
00:48
Yeah. Did you just resign right away yesterday? 

speaker A
00:51
No, I just I just decided on my own. And today I will tell the CEO that I'm going to quit. 

speaker B
01:17
So you quit now because of that? What's your plan? Do you have any plans now that you have already decided to resign or quit from the job? 

speaker A
01:31
Yes, I'm going to take some less maybe for a couple of weeks. And after that, I'm planning to practice some practice? Going to have a job as a programmer too after this. And to do so, I have to prepare for a test which requires me to serve some code problems. 

speaker B
02:23
That's what they call a coding test? 

speaker A
02:25
Yes. 

speaker B
02:27
Okay. That's it. Just what I understood. Coding problems. Okay. During your time working at this company, when you feel stressed, even from your previous boss, when you feel stressed or under pressure, what do you do? Like me? When I'm under pressure or stress, usually it's the stress eating. How about you? 

speaker A
02:53
I like exercise. I like going to the gym. So when I got stressed, I go to the gym. And a few months ago, when I didn't stop playing the violin, I used to play the violin and also the guitar. Playing the guitar. And I like eating too. I used to have some snacks when I got stressed. Especially chocolate. I love it. 

speaker B
03:33
You're going to get fat. 

speaker A
03:36
I got some weight in this company. 

speaker B
03:43
But usually stress eating kind of like that is also the reason why I get fat. Because sometimes unexpectedly, you have a great day, but then suddenly there will be a problem. So you'll be under stress and you just want to get rid of the stress, right? So usually food or eating gets rid of the stress. Just I can say right at the moment. Like after you eat and then you feel good? 

speaker A
04:13
Yes. 

speaker B
04:16
Chocolate. Oh my God. To Ramen. I usually have stocks of Ramen here. 

speaker C
04:26
She ramen. 

speaker B
04:27
Jean ramen. Yeah, I usually have that stock there. But I can only buy those different flavors or noodles online. And ordering here in the Philippines online, it will take two weeks before it arrives. 

speaker C
04:46
Okay. 

speaker B
04:47
But anyways, regarding your problem, hoping you are in the right decision and that's good. Before going on to your next plan or next step, take a rest, breathe, and think over things. So that once you decide to be back on track, everything will be fine. 

speaker A
05:08
Thank you. 

speaker B
05:10
Yes, I think what time do you usually go to office? 

speaker A
05:21
Ten. And I used to go to work by 939 and a half. But these times till ten, maybe by. 

speaker B
05:36
The ten by 10:00 a.m., you go to work. Don't you have the specific nine or nine specific working time? That okay. You should be in this at this time. Usually here in the Philippines, working time is 09:00 A.m.. 09:00 A.m. To 06:00 p.m. Korea time. That's eight to five philippines. So you should not be late. You should be at work before 08:00 A.m.. So I noticed you said 10:00 A.m. You go to work. So do you have the freedom to choose your working time? 

speaker A
06:13
No, I don't. I have to go to the company by ten and the working time is 8 hours. And we have 1 hour of lunch time. So should go home from 07:00 p.m.. But the CEO don't like that. CEO wants for us to work way more than that. Maybe going to be ready to work by nine and a half. And yesterday I go to home. I started to go home. 

speaker A
07:13
I commute yesterday I went back home yesterday. I went back home after 08:00 p.m. Eight and a half. Maybe kind of like when you go. 

speaker B
07:26
To work at ten to eleven. So you usually finish work at around eight and a half. 712 12345, six I think you're even working more than 8 hours, right? 

speaker A
07:43
Yes, but yesterday it was only ending of work. I mean, we used to work more than that. We work by 10:00 p.m usually. And we often work more than that. 

speaker B
08:07
And there's no overtime fee or there is? 

speaker A
08:10
No, there isn't. There isn't. 

speaker B
08:13
What? Your boss cannot demand of working more time as long as you're committing to the 8 hours, I guess, right? 

speaker A
08:29
He expressed some anger, some kind of I don't know the words uncomfortable. 

speaker B
08:42
Being uncomfortable. The feeling of uncomfortable? 

speaker A
08:45
Yeah, he expressed some kind of uncomfortable uncomfortable feeling? 

speaker B
08:53
Yeah. Maybe it's because there's a lot of pressure from him about work. Or maybe there are deadlines or tasks and he's panicking sometimes. I think he doesn't trust as the CEO, I guess he don't trust you. Like, not just you, but under people, workers under him. I think he don't trust. Why would he be doing like this behavior. If you trust your workers, then you know that they will do their best. 

speaker A
09:44
That's one of the reason I'm kidding now. He kind of don't like me. He kind of don't trust me too. 

speaker B
09:57
And for you, it's not healthy to stay. For you, it's not healthy for you to stay. It might also affect your confidence to yourself and be irritated to yourself too if you're going to stay. And your boss is irritated with you. 

speaker A
10:17
Yes, my boss is irritated. 

speaker B
10:21
Actually, the important thing is you are in a healthy and good and working environment because it affects your productivity at all. 

speaker A
10:30
That's right. 

speaker B
10:33
Me, if I don't love this job and maybe if I have a rude boss, I might not stay for a long time in this job. But thankfully, I have good bosses. They always trust us. They care for us teachers. So kind of working. The working environment is really very good. 

speaker A
10:59
I think the working environment and meeting some good policies is very important. 

speaker B
11:09
Very important. It's just like, how can a company be successful without these good workers if you don't have any good relationship? If these two people, if the boss and the workers don't have a good relationship, work will not be efficient and effective. 

speaker A
11:32
Yes. 

speaker B
11:34
Go. I support you. 

speaker A
11:35
Go. 

speaker C
11:39
Okay. 

speaker B
11:40
Anyways oh, we don't have enough time. 

speaker C
11:44
Okay. 

speaker B
11:45
Thank you for sharing and trusting your personal things about work. So I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. 

speaker A
11:53
