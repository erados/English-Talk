What happened yesterday? What happened yesterday? 

speaker B
00:05
Nothing. 

speaker A
00:06
Nothing. You just woke up late? 

speaker B
00:08
Yes. 

speaker A
00:11
Okay, let's have the article about the South Korea ranks 36th for English. Do you want to have that? 

speaker B
00:24
Yes, I read that. 

speaker A
00:27
Okay, let me give you first an article for tomorrow so that I will not forget. Okay. So what are your thoughts on this article saying that Korea ranks 36th for English proficiency? 

speaker B
01:07
I have talked about the purpose of this article. I don't know whether it is real or not. I just came up with an idea that is this article for Koreans. Maybe because the title starts with comparison of English skills of Korea and Japan. I knew that some people in Japan has bad pronunciation. Korea in Japan? 

speaker A
02:10
Japan, yeah. 

speaker B
02:13
But pronunciation so that there was a situation in USA that some kind of how do you call it? Interview with expresident. Donald Trump has heard with many reporters around the world and there were Japanese reporter too. And he asked something to Donald Trump and he couldn't understand what he said. So I knew that Japan has some. 

speaker A
03:25
Problems with pronunciation. Yes, well, that is what I have also heard too. Even teachers who have experienced teaching Japanese but I haven't experienced teaching Japanese from teachers who experience teaching Japanese, they really say it's better to teach Koreans than Japanese because maybe they're the pronunciation. But you know me, I want to prove it myself. But I still don't have the chance to teach Japanese. If I want to really do so, I have to work for another company which I cannot do that anymore. But so far, I don't know this company. We are still developing on catering Japanese. Hopefully I can experience it. But I haven't really heard a Japanese speaking English yet. So far. 

speaker B
04:21
I just thought of the idea that what is the purpose of this article? When he or she wrote this. 

speaker A
04:34
Maybe well, actually this kind of news, even our Philippines just recently, we are ranked as a Singapore event top for English proficiency. It's not us, Singapore. Just recently? Really? Usually you can receive or have this article at the end of the year comparing countries, each countries, every countries with their English proficiency skills. Unfortunately, even some of our teachers, we were shocked. We were shocked because we thought we would be either near Singapore's ranking. But we failed it when it comes to English proficiency. Yes, we understand. But when it comes to reading and a bit speaking, we fail. Singapore is on the top. 

speaker A
05:35
So it's a shame. Like us online teachers, it's a bit discussion for us because oh my God. It's a shame we're teaching Koreans. And when Koreans will see this report and they will not kind of like that issue worried because Koreans might think that we are not really capable to teach English to them because of the news. Okay, other than English, what other language did you learn or want to learn. 

speaker B
06:21
In high school, I learned Japanese. 

speaker A
06:29
Japanese. 

speaker B
06:30
I didn't know how to write those Chinese characters and lead Chinese characters that Japan use. But I can lead Higana and Katakana, which is Japanese characters. I hope I can start learning Japanese again. I want to learn those Chinese characters they use. And also I want to learn how to use Chinese too. Because there are so many Chinese in this world and I want to have there is so many Chinese in Korea too. 

speaker B
07:31
And I want to communicate with them in Chinese. Who knows? Who knows? There are so many Chinese people who have some kinds of stores in Korea. 

speaker A
07:51
Some kind of restaurant in Korea, I guess. Both Chinese and Japanese also have a lot of stores in Korea. And also with them, I guess. Right? 

speaker B
08:02
And who knows what they will give to me when I order some food in Chinese or Japanese. 

speaker A
08:20
So what you've learned before, you forgot it already? The Japanese. 

speaker B
08:28
Chinese characters. I remember half of Japanese characters. 

speaker A
08:42
No, you mentioned it. Is it true that one of the subjects in Korea is including Japanese language? 

speaker B
08:52
Including? 

speaker A
08:54
Yeah, like in school in Korea. Like there is math, science, English, math, PE. And then there's a Japanese subject. 

speaker B
09:04
Yes. You can choose what you own as a second foreign language. There. You can choose Chinese, Japanese, even Arabic. 

speaker A
09:21
And then English. 

speaker B
09:25
English is different than there was a kind of curriculum that the students have to follow. And it has been changed since I was from Curriculum Island. But when I was in high school, there was two parts of student, two kind of curriculum that students can follow. One is scientific and the other island. Liberal arts. Yes, liberal art. 

speaker A
10:29
Liberal arts. Liberal arts. 

speaker B
10:31
Yeah. 

speaker A
10:36
Liberal arts. Liberal arts. 

speaker B
10:41
And students in liberal arts should just walk around. But in scientific era scientific curriculum, there is no such thing. There is no second for the language thing. 

speaker A
11:12
Okay. How many percent of Koreans do you think you're just own estimation? How many percent of Koreans do you think can really speak English but are just shy or afraid to speak out? 

speaker B
11:29
More than 80. 

speaker A
11:31
80. 

speaker B
11:33
The other 20 have into abort and they got confident because they have experienced using English. Most of Koreans have no such experience. Just to go above as a trip, travel, not for study. So I think about 80% of Koreans are shy. 

speaker A
12:13
Can speak English, but are just shy and afraid. Right? 

speaker B
12:22
Because they learn English in schools. 

speaker A
12:28
Actually online. Also, there are a lot of companies catering Koreans more than Japanese or Chinese that are learning English. Actually. Let's just imagine it from my first company before, right now, I know they have thousands of students, maybe less thousands. Here in my company, almost $1,000 from the third company, I'm working almost 1000 too. So imagine it. How much more with the other companies that are teaching English to Korean. So I'm sure there are really that's estimatedly 80% of Koreans really can speak and understand English but are just shy. 

speaker B
13:14
I think this course is better helpful for me to get some confidence in using English. Indeed, yes. 

speaker A
13:31
Okay, thank you for sharing your thoughts and opinions for today's class. It was a great discussion, actually. Okay. Tomorrow's topic, I already sent it to you. Okay. 

speaker B
13:45
Yes. 

speaker A
13:47
Have a great day. 

speaker B
13:48
Have a great day. 

speaker A
13:50
