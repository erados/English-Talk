speaker A
00:00
Advantage and disadvantages of dress code. 

speaker B
00:04
Advantage when I was in middle school, in high school, I don't have to think about what to wear today. 

speaker A
00:15
That's correct. That's number one. 

speaker B
00:17
Yes, that was and in these days in these days, I buy some kind of clothing way more than before. And I noticed that wearing a clothes that express myself is a kind of joy. 

speaker A
00:51
Okay. 

speaker B
00:52
So if there are some kind of restrictions to me, what to where in these days, I feel some kind of stress. 

speaker C
01:10
So that's one of cons. 

speaker A
01:16
One of the cons in schools, the company that you are working for. Do you have a dress code? Did you have a dress code? 

speaker B
01:25
No, I didn't. So I have to think about what to wear today. 

speaker A
01:33
Or maybe the night. You have to choose. Oh, I have to wear something else or you will be pressured to like, I have to buy something else because I have been wearing this on and on and on. 

speaker B
01:47
Yes. 

speaker A
01:49
And the disadvantage. 

speaker B
01:54
Actually pros, I mean sorry, sorry. 

speaker A
01:59
Pros. Okay. 

speaker B
02:01
You mean the other pros? 

speaker A
02:03
Yes. 

speaker B
02:07
I actually read that from the article and I agreed. It makes people feel some kind of connected in the group. 

speaker A
02:26
Can you say that one more time? It may. 

speaker B
02:29
It makes people feel some kind of connected in group. 

speaker C
02:36
People feel some kind of unity by wearing the same clothes. 

speaker A
02:43
Okay. Like they are recognized to be like, in one group. 

speaker B
02:47
Yes. 

speaker A
02:49
So there's a connection. 

speaker C
02:50
Connection, yes. 

speaker A
02:54
It also made me think you're wearing uniforms. It saves time to laundry. I know. Yeah, time to laundry. Instead of wearing a lot of clothes every day, a lot of dirty clothes that you have to clean up. Right, right. In a uniform. Actually, when I wear uniform when I was in high school no, even elementary, high school, middle school, high school, we have the uniforms because I was in a private school. So as long as one uniform, it can be used, as long as it's not dirty, it doesn't smell bad, and we still wear one uniform for two days. And then usually we have two sets of uniform because there are only five school days. So two sets of uniform. So one uniform for two days, or one uniform for three days. So at the end of the week, there are only two uniforms from the student in a family. 

speaker A
03:58
So very less time for our parents or to do laundry. 

speaker B
04:02
Right, you can say that again. Because I am living in this house alone. This is a small house and I live separate from my parents, and I have to do my laundry on my own. 

speaker A
04:27
Yeah. 

speaker B
04:28
And I feel that I feel exactly what you said. 

speaker A
04:36
Exactly. So there's really you have to think all the time that, oh, this time I should do laundry because I have a lot already to clean up already. And after that washing, you have to fold the clothes clean, right? That's really the same. But if you will be asked to choose, would you like to have an office where you will have this certain dress code or you want to freely just wear what is suitable for an office? 

speaker C
05:12
In my office. 

speaker A
05:15
If you'll be asked to choose, do you want to have a dress code or no, I have. 

speaker B
05:21
To think about it for a while. 

speaker C
05:39
No uniform? 

speaker A
05:41
No uniform. 

speaker B
05:43
The office I can choose what wear to work because I already bought some clothes and it's kind of boring to wear uniforms. Although it has some advantages in the office. As I told you before, it makes people feel some kind of unity. And as the article says, it improves the safeness. But I will take responsibilities for wearing what I wear, so I prefer. 

speaker C
06:44
That. 

speaker A
06:44
So you prefer having no uniforms? 

speaker C
06:47
I prefer having no uniforms. 

speaker A
06:49
Yes. Well, I guess also the thing is that they are wearing no uniforms. What I can also see as an advantage is that people can express themselves through their clothes, colors, designs, trending fashion that express their feelings. Right. People have some different like they have their favorite color to wear. Right. 

speaker C
07:20
That is important. 

speaker A
07:22
Yes. 

speaker B
07:39
What color do you like? 

speaker A
07:41
Purple, obviously. I'm a purple lady. I have a purple mouse bag. I have a purple bag. I have a purple pen. Wow. My tumbler or my flask. My water container is purple. My yoga mat is purple. My wallet is purple. 

speaker B
08:11
Wow. 

speaker A
08:16
Actually, just this year, just suddenly I love purple. 

speaker B
08:21
This year? 

speaker A
08:22
Yeah, I just started this year. Just suddenly I just love purple. I have a purple cap, I have a purple tshirt, purple shorts. Shorts, purple shoes. 

speaker B
08:35
Same as you. I kind of started to love greens in these days. My cell phone is green, my watch is green and my electronic devices are green. 

speaker A
08:52
I don't know sooner my mouse in my laptop will also be purple. Yeah, I don't know. I love it. I love the color and it makes me feel wonderful. Okay, I know we don't have enough much time, but I will send you another article. 

speaker B
09:14
Okay. 

speaker A
09:16
We can also do this. So I will send it to you today so that you can have time to read it. Okay, thank you. I'm sure this will be interesting for you. Okay, I'll see you then tomorrow. 

speaker B

Exercise in this morning I haven't wear anything else other than the input. I didn't wear anything else other than my uniform before. 

speaker B
10:11
