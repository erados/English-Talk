I cannot turn on the lights because my husband last night was drunk. So he's still asleep. I cannot turn on the lights. Yes, he's still sleeping. So what's going to be our article this morning? The man being fired? 

speaker B
00:23
Yes. 

speaker A
00:25
Okay. The man being fired for being boring. Is that really possible? Okay, I read the story already. I forgot this. Okay. The previous company you recently worked no, the previous company you work, does the company often organize social activities for employees? 

speaker B
01:02
Yes, especially unexpected ones. We used to have some kind of having meal together with beers and so juice time to time when the senior wants to. There was some after work drinking activities. 

speaker A
01:55
Okay, so like, is it I don't know if it's correct, but in Japan they say if a new employee or I think it's an activity in their office after work, they really gather and have some drinks. Is it true? 

speaker B
02:16
We usually go to Par to drink. 

speaker A
02:30
Is that already a custom in Korea? Like, let's say, for example, new employee boy or let's say especially if it's a man. So do you usually welcome it with having a drink after work? 

speaker B
02:50
I only worked for just a company and I don't know what others do, but in my ex company, I remember that the first day for new colleagues, we just had the meal, not drinks, but as time goes by, months and months, we drank a lot. 

speaker A
03:35
Okay. Is there anyone at your previous company who is difficult to work with? 

speaker B
03:47
Yes, there was. He majored in computer science and I approached him to be friendly with him, but he was so signature that I couldn't be friends with. I don't know why he was kind to those girls in the company, but he was not the kind to me. 

speaker A
04:42
Okay. Usually when you have that kind of problem in your office, do you just let it be and just continue what you do or you talk to that person with your issue with him or with him or her? 

speaker B
04:59
I just gently control what I feel and what I think about them. And I tried to forget them first for some months and after that, even though I tried to, but if they don't react with good 

speaker B
06:01
reaction, I don't. 

speaker A
06:03
Know. 

speaker B
06:06
I just keep up. 

speaker A
06:08
I just give up. 

speaker B
06:09
Yes. 

speaker A
06:11
Okay. The light is disturbing my eyes. Okay. I have already asked about you this so far. Even though there are things that you didn't like about your company, that is one of the reason why you quit, right? But I'm sure there are also good things that you like about the company. What was the good thing about it? About the company that you previously worked? 

speaker B
06:46
Colleagues. Your colleagues, most of them was good to work together. They were fascinated and loved working and kind for each other. 

speaker A
07:14
So there are still good you had good memories with your colleagues at work. 

speaker B
07:20
Yes, colleagues and I'm about to meet one in this month, December 20. 

speaker A
07:34
Okay, so you will be meeting one of your colleagues. Yes. What made that colleague very good with you? What is it that interests you? His characters. 

speaker B
07:49
He's very smart. Actually, not he, but she could see that she's works are her works are supporting and tiring things to do. But she never showed such an expression that she doesn't want to do that. 

speaker A
08:40
Even if she is working boring or tiring thing. She doesn't show it, but just keep on going what she's doing. 

speaker B
08:50
Yes. 

speaker A
08:54
Okay. What qualities. Okay. Do you think you could be a leader? Do you think you could build your own business? No, you don't want to? 

speaker B
09:21
Technical Leadering Company and I found that it is very hard to do. I had to deal with so much things in that position. I had to organize my members, distribute work properly for those members. In the same time, I had to do my work too. Mind blowing responsibilities. 

speaker B
10:35
Many responsibilities in that position. It was such a burden for me. That's one of the reasons I quit. 

speaker A
10:56
Okay. Well, in a company just like a house, if there's a good leader in the house, it will go well. No one will quit. If the environment is really good, everything happy and satisfied, right? The company, it's not just the workers that are benefiting from a good working environment and good leadership, but also the company will progress a lot, right? 

speaker B
11:26
Yes, sure. 

speaker A
11:30
Just like a machine. Just like our brain is the center of our body. If it doesn't function very well, then it affects everything at all on us. Right? Okay. And what do you imagine are the most stressful job? Everything. Every job is really stressful. But what do you think is the most stressful job? 

speaker B
11:58
Customer service. There are so many strangers in this world and dealing with conversation with them. 

speaker A
12:14
Is the most hardest conversation with them. Do you mean to say having a conversation with them is the most stressful for customer service assistant? Right? 

speaker B
12:51
Yes. It might be okay to just talk to those no more people. But there are some kind of insane people in there. 

speaker A
13:10
Yeah, there are. Really? That's the thing. Different characters of people. There are people that we thought at first are good people. Then suddenly they became rude. 

speaker B
13:23
Yes. 

speaker A
13:25
I have experienced being a customer service assistant. Actually, when I worked in a DVD rental shop way back, let's say the year when DVDs were very famous, there was really one very famous DVD rental shop here in the city. I guess that was my first job in college. Dealing with some people that we are talking about DVDs here and CDs. So we have to be careful on that. Right? So you know, these people that asking for assistance but are so rude, but you can't shout or you can't be rude to them because they are customers. And customers, as they say, customers are always right. So you have to stay calm. No matter what they say and shout at you or being rude to you. But you have to stay calm. Even you're a cashier, it's still the same. 

speaker A
14:26
You're still a customer service assistant. I can agree with you. It's really stressful because it affects your job. 

speaker B
14:41
It might be very hard for you to deal in with them. 

speaker A
14:46
Yeah, it was alright. We also don't have enough much time. Let's continue tomorrow. I guess tomorrow's topic is going to be interesting. Gone. 

speaker B
14:56
Okay. 

speaker A
15:00
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. 

speaker B
15:02
You tomorrow. Bye.
