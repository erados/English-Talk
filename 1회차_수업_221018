Passion to talk in English to Korean and during my free time, which is the weekend, I spend it with my family. And I am married, but no kids yet. Can you tell me more about yourself? 

speaker B
00:17
My name is Myeu and I'm a student in a university, fourth grade. And my hobby is going to the gym. I love exercising, but especially exercise I have to do on my own. 

speaker A
00:48
Not with other people, not with any instructors or something. But just go to the gym and exercise on your own? 

speaker B
00:57
Yeah, on my own. 

speaker A
00:58
Obviously. I can see it in your caco. 

speaker B
01:07
I used to play the BioIn maybe two, three months ago. I stopped it because it is too hard for me to practice and going to the work together at the same time. 

speaker A
01:31
So kind of like your work balance or work and life balance is not already stable. 

speaker B
01:37
So actually there is a biling here. 

speaker A
01:43
Oh, yes. Okay. Don't you miss? I mean, you stopped for two to three months, right? So are you planning to stop permanently or just for a while? 

speaker B
02:03
Maybe for a while. Because I started playing the BioIn since I was very young. I was in elementary school, maybe fourth grade. I was maybe ten at the time. And I stopped playing the buyer for a while. But after that, I least start learning the violin. 

speaker A
02:47
Wait, during your childhood years, you already play violin? That's already your interest of instrument? 

speaker B
02:54
Yes, I like playing instruments. I like playing piano, playing the guitar and playing the bio. Actually, there is guitar over there. 

speaker A
03:14
I think it's easy for you to form a musical band. 

speaker B
03:18
Yes. 

speaker A
03:19
Wow. You can play guitar. You don't need to compete. But you play guitar. Violin, it's not easy to learn those instruments. 

speaker B
03:31
Yes. 

speaker A
03:35
It takes force in your hand when you play the guitar. Right. 

speaker B
03:42
You have to push force. 

speaker A
03:43
And like this. And violin, I guess a bit strength to pocket. Right? 

speaker B
03:52
I think the violin is most. 

speaker A
03:57
Pressuring. 

speaker B
03:58
Hardest instruments to run. 

speaker A
04:03
Oh, because you force here, plus you force here. 

speaker B
04:08
It's very hard to match my left hand and my right hand. And the sound. That instrument is so sentimental, so I don't know the word. MINGAM han very sensitive. Yeah. 

speaker A
04:34
You mean by violent instrument has a really sentimental value for you? 

speaker B
04:43
No, I I want you to say that the filing is very sensitive. 

speaker A
04:53
The violin itself, instruments yeah. 

speaker B
04:59
To any other environment, like humidity or sunshine. So it's very hard to manage and play the BioIn. So I think that's the most hardest instrument in the world. 

speaker A
05:19
Okay. And sports do you play? Since you are very you already showed great interest about musical instrument. How about sports? Do you play any sports? Like famous encores soccer? Right? 

speaker B
05:39
I actually don't like experts. I don't have that good sense to moving my body quickly. I think I'm very calm and slow. 

speaker A
06:03
Sometimes by kind of like a gentle person. 

speaker B
06:07
Maybe it was hard for me to compete in sports games when it comes. 

speaker A
06:19
To, like, maybe competition, you would be far from it, because you're not that really fast. 

speaker B
06:25
Yes, and I think that's why I like to go to the gym and work exercise on my own. 

speaker A
06:38
Okay. Do you have a brother or sister? I mean, how about your family? 

speaker B
06:43
I have one sister, one other sister, and she's three years older than me, and she's elementary school teacher now. She's been work maybe two to three years. 

speaker A
07:04
She has been working as a teacher for two to three years. 

speaker B
07:08
She has been working as a teacher. 

speaker A
07:12
For two to three years now. 

speaker B
07:14
As a teacher for two to three years now. Yes. 

speaker A
07:17
And you are also working now too, right? 

speaker B
07:20
Yes, I'm a student, but I go to the work part time, maybe full time. I have to go to work ten, and the contract says I can go to home. I can go to home after work. 

speaker A
07:48

08:11
Web programmer? Wait, programmer? What is your major? What are you studying? 

speaker B
08:18
I major in electrical engineering. 

speaker A
08:26
Electrical engineering? I'm sorry, I'm not really knowledgeable what's? Electrical engineering then? You're working as a web programmer? 

speaker B
08:34
There are some gap between that. Okay, yeah, you're right. 

speaker A
08:41
I'm really not knowledgeable about that. Engineering programmer. I know there is an it, but I was thinking, how does it relate your studying engineering, and then your job is for the programmer. Okay, I got it. 

speaker B
08:55
There are some common points in that, but usually people who major in electrical engineering don't go to work as a programmer. Yeah, exactly. But I do. 

speaker A
09:21
Yeah, but that's a good I mean, web programmers, it actually I submit these people because you are the ones who are the part of the technology now, I guess without web programmers, without it, the technology we are using now will not be possible. 

speaker B
09:41
Right. Thank you. 

speaker A
09:44
I really salute you. The kind of mind you have to be creative. You don't have the creative mind. Not all are gifted with a creative mind. So thank you. 

speaker B
09:58

speaker A
10:04
Yes, exactly. These phones could not be possible. This will not be working without all your knowledge and your creative mind. Okay, and so what else do I have to know about new role? Anybody who is inspiring you? Maybe a girlfriend? 

speaker B
10:29
Girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend, but I have a I don't know. This is like the way to express I have a girl who I have a favor. 

speaker A
10:53
You mean to say you are admiring somebody? 

speaker B
10:57
Admiring not a strong emotion, but some kind of positive infatuation or crush infatuation. I don't know that word. Maybe some kind of like you like. 

speaker A
11:18
Her, but you don't know yet if that is love. 

speaker B
11:20
Yes. And I'm going to watch a movie with her this weekend. 

speaker A
11:33
I feel electrified. It's so cute because I think what you are having right now is you enjoy being with her. 

speaker B
11:45
Yes. 

speaker A
11:46
There is kind of like you feel the electrifying connection, but you don't know if that is love, but you're just enjoying what you have with her. 

speaker B
11:55
Yes, I like with her. I like talking with her. 

speaker A
12:00
That's exciting. Okay. Anyway, we don't have enough much time, but I'm going to what do you want for a class? Use an article. These are new articles every day where you can read it in advance, and then we talk about that in the class. 

speaker B
12:20
What kind of class do you. 

speaker A
12:24
Usually? Free talking. We cannot just free talk without a topic. Of course, you will ask me a topic. So actually, when I do a free talking, I send an article to my student, let them read it in advance. Like, for example, today I will send an article, you read that, then tomorrow we talk about that. 

speaker B
12:45
That would be good. Yeah. 

speaker A
12:47
Because these articles are fresh articles every day from different business, entertainment, health, everything. And then, of course, you might wonder, from tomorrow, officially, we will be using the article. You might wonder why I do like this. It's because I'm typing for your mistakes. 

speaker B
13:11
Okay. Yes. 

speaker A
13:14
When you see me, you might misunderstood me, that you might say I'm not listening. But actually, I don't use my laptop to type. I don't like it. So I use my phone to take down or write down your mistakes and give correction. 

speaker B
13:28
Okay, thank you. 

speaker A
13:31
And then, of course, if there is like, oh, teacher, I don't like the topic, can we change it? Just send me a message and I'll be very glad to change it right away. The important thing is you're comfortable having fun while developing and enhancing your English. Okay? 

speaker B
13:48
Okay. 

speaker A
13:49
All right. Learning is an every ending process. New fighting. 

speaker B
13:55
Fighting, yes. 

speaker A
13:57
So I'll send you an article today and we will discuss it tomorrow. 

speaker B
14:01
Yes. Okay. 

speaker A
14:03
All right. We don't have enough much time. 15 minutes is too short. So I'll see you tomorrow. 

speaker B
14:07
