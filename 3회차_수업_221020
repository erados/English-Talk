speaker A
00:42
Morning. Different view right now. Where are you? 

speaker B
00:52
Actually, this is same place but with different angles. Because I have a lot of things on my desk which are brought from my workplace, as you know. Already done? Yeah, I'm done. 

speaker A
01:23
Okay. Tell me, how did you talk to your boss? 

speaker B
01:26
I just tell him that I just told him. I just told him that it is too hard for me to work gently with him. 

speaker A
01:49
Gently? You just call him kindly and gently. 

speaker B
01:52
Kindly. 

speaker A
01:53
Okay. 

speaker B
01:57
He understood that he was some he was irritated. He admitted that. 

speaker A
02:11
What did he admit that he's irritated on you? 

speaker B
02:16
I didn't catch him. 

speaker A
02:19
You mean to say your boss admitted that he is irritated on you or he was just really irritable? 

speaker B
02:28
He was admitted that he irritated to me. 

speaker A
02:35
Oh, why? 

speaker B
02:38
He said that because he loved me and he wanted for me to be better. To be better in that way? Yes. To better programmer. I don't know word. 

speaker A
03:05
He is irritated to you because he just wants you to get better. To be a better programmer? 

speaker B
03:12
Yes. 

speaker A
03:15
Okay. I can't understand his reason. 

speaker B
03:20
I just know it. And we broke off in a very good word, I think. 

speaker A
03:36
When he said that he was irritated on you because he just want you to be a better programmer. After talking to him, did you think of what was that reason? Why did you come to your mind like he was irritated because he wants me to become a better programmer. It doesn't make sense. 

speaker B
04:10
There are some there's there is some folks about eager mom who put her child, her children off the cliff to make them to be good ego. And I understood him that way. But he went too much. He went too much. 

speaker A
04:50
That's my point. It's okay if he was on the right average level of being irritated to you. Because maybe of course, if that's the case so he thinks that oh, this person needs more to know an experience about programming. It's okay. But I guess together, let's say okay. He's irritated on you on an average level. But I think the right way is for him to guide you more even though he's a little bit irritated, but more of 100% irritated on you. That makes you uncomfortable. That's already not a good work essay. 

speaker B
05:31
That's exactly why the reason why I. 

speaker A
05:35
Quit that's the reason why I quit why I quit. Okay. Was there any compensation that you receive? 

speaker B
05:49
Compensation? Actually, no. There are some kind of money I can get from the company if I worked over a year. But in this company, I only worked for three months, four months. So I have no chance to get some kind of heating money. 

speaker A
06:27
But just receiving your remaining working days, the salary of those days, right? 

speaker B
06:37
Yes. Maybe half of the month, half of the money as I worked for 15 days in this month. 

speaker A
06:50
Okay. So finally you are relieved. From a stressful situation every day and. 

speaker B
07:01
Actually I woke up late today because I have more time in the morning. 

speaker A
07:12
That's also the good thing, the kind of feeling that you don't need to wake up with a lot of pressure and not waking up and thinking oh, I'm going to go to the work again today. It's a burden feeling but now you can wake up with a smile and with an easy feeling already. 

speaker B
07:33
Yeah, but I also have some worries about my future and why have to do next. 

speaker A
07:43
Step. So kind of like you're going to be going back to the basic repair, those application letters, interviews, et cetera. 

speaker B
07:59
I'm going to just take some rest and maybe study that kind of things, prepare to job interview, something like that. 

speaker A
08:20
Take a rest for a while and then if you're ready, then you know for yourself when you are ready to start again. And hopefully by this time when you start again, you can find a good working environment. But isn't it that you can also ask from your previous company what is it? Recommendation letter or certificate employment something? 

speaker B
08:47
Yes, he said that he can write some recommendation letters for me but it's my own character that I want to do something on my own without any others have because I want to achieve it on my own. 

speaker A
09:19
Not because of our search and recommendation better. You are really an independent thinker. 

speaker B
09:30
Yeah, I am. 

speaker A
09:33
Okay, good luck to your next step and hopefully it will be the best. 

speaker B
09:39
Thank you. 

speaker A
09:42
Okay, I think you're going to be having a great breakfast or whatever. It's brunch today. Okay. It's a beautiful day. It's a beautiful day for you and it is our article today. 

speaker B
10:00
Article today? 

speaker A
10:03
What article did you read? 

speaker B
10:05
I actually read posts but like to say about the one with cold water swimming about cold water? 

speaker A
10:26
Well, this is surface. Did it surprise you that what is this? Cold bath will reduce fat price? Hold on, I'm just opening it. Okay. Do you find it surprising that ice basing will reduce body fat? Actually is a bit surprising for me because I know Asala or making our body sweat reduce the fats but ice bathing. 

speaker B
11:09
I thought in a different way when I just let the title hold on. 

speaker A
11:21
The process of saying is thought not thought not the heart thought. 

speaker B
11:30
Can you do it again? 

speaker A
11:32
Okay. You said I thought right? I thought because when somebody listens to you they might misinterpret you that you're saying the process of teach. 

speaker B
11:48
I thought yeah, when I read the title I thought that because the cold water lowers my body temperature, my body needs to burn some calories from the pet. So I thought that originally makes sense that court will pass code passing but it's not only body patty pet it was bad party pet, bad body fat changing into good one so it was surprising. 

speaker A
12:50
So there's an ice can you do it? Can you endure it? 

speaker B
12:59
Maybe. I see betting. 

speaker A
13:03
Yeah, I can't. With an ice in my bathtub where maybe I can. But I need to have a hot soup and coffee. Beside me. 

speaker B
13:20
There is a picture of ice. 

speaker A
13:29
I can imagine. Have you tried bathing or swimming in a very cold water? 

speaker B
13:47
I sometimes do that. I sometimes turn off the boiler, turn off the hot water system, and take a shower with very cold water because it makes me feel better. It reduces my stress and makes my mood better. When I do that, I do something like oh cho. And it naturally made me smile. I don't know why, because it makes me smile. 

speaker A
14:34
Okay, we don't have enough much time, but I will send you an article. This is not an endo article, but I want to hear your opinion. You can choose from any of this article. Okay? 

speaker B
14:53
Yes. 

speaker A
14:54
I can say these articles are very I can say it will make your mind crazy to think about the situation, but I wanted to know your thought about this. Okay. You can just choose from any of this article I sent you. All right. 

speaker B
15:13
Exciting. 

speaker A
15:16
It's not a really long article, but what can I say? It's a brainy. 

speaker B
15:21
Brainy. 

speaker A
15:22
It's a brainy article. I just want to know your opinion tomorrow. Okay. 

speaker B
15:29
I like brainy ones. 

speaker A
15:31
Okay, that's I like it. So you can choose from any of that for tomorrow. Okay? 

speaker B
15:36
Okay. 

speaker A
15:37
I'll see you tomorrow. 

speaker B
15:39
See you tomorrow. Or less. 

speaker A
15:41
Bye.
