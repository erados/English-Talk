speaker A
00:17
Done with exercising? 

speaker B
00:20
No, I talked about coffee. I'm going to do my exercise in the afternoon. 

speaker A
00:35
It's hard to wake up early morning. 

speaker B
00:37
Right? It's very hard to wake up early in the morning. I don't know. 

speaker A
00:46
I guess we can call laziness. 

speaker B
00:50
Laziness? 

speaker A
00:52
Yeah. Because morning usually we just really want to sleep. 

speaker B
00:56
Right. 

speaker A
00:58
Okay. It was going to be our article this morning. 

speaker B
01:05
About leaving. 

speaker A
01:17
Did you read this? 

speaker B
01:19
I skimmed it. Skimmed. Is it light expression? 

speaker A
01:27
Kim. What do you mean? Skimming? 

speaker B
01:33
Wait a second. I just scanned it because I just five minutes. 

speaker A
01:55
He didn't read this yesterday. 

speaker B
01:58
I thought I'm today I'm gonna wake up early and read it today? Yeah, five minutes ago. Okay, I got the point of it. 

speaker A
02:17
But I guess this topic is just very easy because it's just all about reading. Common topic, I guess. So, do you like reading books or do you like reading just reading anything? Magazines, comics, newspapers, articles. 

speaker B
02:39
Do you like I used to when I was very young. I was born in very luter place. When I was in elementary school, there was eight just eight students in the class. 

speaker A
03:13
Eight students? 

speaker B
03:15
Yeah, only eight students in the class. And most of them were not near at my place, my home. So I had to play alone most time. And I found that leading book was one of the things I can enjoy at the moment. I used to read the book a lot. Every week I went to the library and out of some books. They were usually about diverse or scientific stuff. I believe that is the reason why I grew up as an engineer. 

speaker A
04:23
What benefits can we get from reading? 

speaker B
04:41
How do you create the opposite of direct? Indirect. 

speaker A
04:46
Indirect? 

speaker B
04:49
Via reading books, we can indirectly experience what the author experienced. And by that we can imagine what you like, what it would be. Although I didn't in the in his environment or her environment, I can just imagine about it. And by that, as the article says, I can learn how they call it, make 

speaker B
05:53
it easy to do that. 

speaker A
05:57
What else? What else are the other benefits of reading? Generally? 

speaker B
06:03
Generally it makes younger people to build the knowledge of grammar and vocabulary correct. 

speaker A
06:23
And I guess it's also a good exercise for our brain, right, for our mind. But I don't want reading. It's boring. 

speaker B
06:36
Look at this. I bought a lot of book, but I finished just a few. I finished maybe a couple of books. I almost always start a leading book but couldn't finish one. Cannot finish one. 

speaker A
06:57
Usually that's what I also ask when I see my students having video classes. And then usually the background is having bookshelves. And then I will really ask, is that your bookshelves? And they will say yes. Kids are not really kids, but adults are professionals. And they say yes. And I said and I asked them, did you read all those books? And they will just say few books only. 

speaker B
07:23
That's very mindy timing. I don't know. 

speaker A
07:31
So I guess maybe those books usually even here at home we don't have any bookshelves. But I know there's very little bookshelf. There are a lot of books there. Those were the books of my husband and my father in law when they were still studying and working. My father in law's job was a C man working in the ship. So those were the books that he used to even if he's already at work, he still used that book. So it was there book of my husband when he studied as auto mechanic. So they were still there. But usually Filipinos don't have these bookshelves at home. 

speaker B
08:24
I didn't have my own book shares too until I started buying books about six months ago. 

speaker A
08:45
Actually, I expected already mostly Koreans have a lot of books because studying is really very when it comes to studying, even from elementary, even you're working is still there. So like your references mostly are having or buying books, right? 

speaker B
09:03
Mostly. And you know what? In these days the technical environment was changed. People in school used to not they are not going to buy books and they just download it. 

speaker A
09:39
The technology is helping out instead of as much as possible. If they can find a copy or details on the Internet, they will just have it there. 

speaker B
09:49
Yeah. And they use some kind of tablet. 

speaker A
09:57
Like a reading material tablet or thing. What is that? Ebook or e reading something gadget and. 

speaker B
10:07
Ipad more deluxe tabs. The kind of devices are being necessary these days and half of my friends have it, more than half. And when they are studying, when they go to the class, when they take lectures, they turn the PDF files of the books. 

speaker A
10:46
So kind of like ebook or something, they're using it instead of books. Well, the technology is also making students make it easier, not harder. Because on the usual before this technology came, we really have to carry our bags with those heavy or sometimes heavy books or few books in our bags, which sometimes carrying bags is inconvenient for us, right? 

speaker B
11:12
No, in their bag they just have one device, not books of their major. 

speaker A
11:25
Exactly. Which I guess even in school, in elementary, the teachers are also there are already schools that are using instead of books. They are using something like iPad or something in order for kids to bring at home and study there instead of books. 

speaker B
11:45
Right. 

speaker A
11:48
Even teachers now don't write on the boards but instead there's a video already there to be shown. 

speaker B
11:55
Sure. The copy situation the Pandemic has affiliated, I think yeah. 

speaker A
12:04
There was also a good thing during the Pandemic. It made the technology more innovative for people. 

speaker B
12:15
In what innovative? 

speaker A
12:18
Being innovative. 

speaker B
12:20
Innovative. 

speaker A
12:23
How do you spell I-N-N Innovative. I-N-N-O-V technology were upgraded. Some technologies technologies were innovative during the Pandemic to help people make their works or schools or education more easier even if they were just at home in their convenience. Well, yeah, truly during the Pandemic we are more into gadgets, phones, tablets, iPads because we need to do jobs online or students need to study, continue studying online too. 

speaker B
13:24
But in the same time, I think in my opinion but at the same time but at the same time, in my opinion, the improvement of collision those devices make people hard to concentrate on the leading itself because it has so much distraction stuff in the device. You can visit the YouTube, you can surf the internet. 

speaker A
13:59
That's true. That's the disadvantage. Also using online, because there will be a lot you will really be tempted to open other apps instead of what you needed to do. 

speaker B
14:12
Yes. I feel these days I'm studying right now, starting to get a certificate, and I have to watch a video, but I cannot focus on it more than 30 minutes. 

speaker A
14:33
Because you want to? Oh, there's a video. I need to watch it. That is really true. Good thing for me I don't use YouTube. I do have YouTube on my phone, my laptop. But I'm not a YouTube user. I don't watch videos on YouTube. I don't even watch TV shows. But I can watch Korean. Drama but I don't know I really just watch Korean dramas on my break time to make me fall asleep but during work is really work for me. I don't easily get tempted about work and do the other watching of videos. 

speaker B
15:14
Have I been thank you. 

speaker A
15:16
We don't have enough much time yes. 

speaker B
15:21

speaker A
15:24
Yeah about it okay, I'll just send you a new article okay okay, I'll see you then. Bye bye. 

speaker B
