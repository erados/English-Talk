You? Morning. Hi. 

speaker B
00:43
How are you doing? How was your weekend? 

speaker A
00:48
I got a certification test and I passed one. And I have been to some kind of conference. 

speaker B
01:05
What is that? So the certification test, it happened during the weekend? 

speaker A
01:22
Yes, it was on Saturday. Last Saturday. 

speaker B
01:28
Okay. And the weather was very good during the weekend. 

speaker A
01:35
Weather? In Korea, I think the winter is already started and the weather was so cold that the degree was once below the zero degree. 

speaker B
02:01
Below zero degree? 

speaker A
02:02
Yeah, it was once minus one degree searches. 

speaker B
02:07
That's very cold. Is that so far the coldest temperature you ever experience. 

speaker A
02:18
In these days? Yes. 

speaker B
02:24
During this kind of season, cold. Are there any things that you usually do or do you usually have routines during this kind of season that it's cold routine? There are four seasons in Korea, right? Winter, spring, summer, and fall. So during this kind of cold seasons, are there things that you usually do during cold season. 

speaker A
03:03
And cold season? 

speaker B
03:06
Not really. 

speaker A
03:07
Yes, not really. 

speaker B
03:11
Usually here in Filipinos, if it's always raining and cold, usually we like having foods that are example hot soup. Coffee will always be there. Are these porridge? Porridge is a hot rice. You know it's a porridge, right? We usually like that one. But during a hot sunny day, we usually like just any drinks that have lots of eyes. Okay. Anyways, my weekend yesterday, I always spend it with my family. And yesterday was the advanced birthday meal with my sister because today is her 

speaker B
04:15
birthday and it's a working day. So not actually that we can be gathered during the weekday. So yesterday we had just small meal with us family and yeah, nothing else special. 

speaker A
04:35
Yeah. Did you sing a song in the party? 

speaker B
04:53
There wasn't really a party this Wednesday. This Wednesday is going to be really the party here. Because it's the birthday of my husband this Wednesday. So there will be a car. Okay. This Wednesday. But yesterday, nothing because it's an advanced birthday. Usually Filipinos do celebrate it on the birthday. So Wednesday afternoon, there's going to be a birthday celebration here. Party food scar out and. 

speaker A
05:32
You look like three P today. 

speaker B
05:35
I just woke up. Yeah, I just woke up because I had a 1 hour break. My two students before you were absent. So I just managed to just go back to sleep. Sorry. 

speaker A
05:51
I woke up at eight and I just slept again. And that's why. Actually, I think that's because we appear sleepy. Because it is winter. 

speaker B
06:18
Usually if it's cold, if our surroundings is very cold, I don't know. Naturally, we just want to be in the bed, right? 

speaker A
06:29
Yes. And we have to like animals, like bears. We have to hibernate. 

speaker B
06:47
Oh my God. This is how really? A m if I just woke up early I woke up early for my first class. Actually, 06:00 a.m.. I took an absent because I was still sleepy. Because my husband last night was having so much coughing. I think he's catching cold. So he was coughing and coughing. So we couldn't sleep early. So I canceled my 06:00 a.m class. But then I made a class at 645. And then the next thing actually three after 645, three students absent before you. So I just managed to go back to sleep because everything is too cold here, even though the sun is rising already. So it's like I will just wake up. Our class time is 830, so I will just wake up at 825. 

speaker A
07:51
Do you have a lot of class at morning or at afternoon? 

speaker B
07:56
Morning and morning, I have really a lot of classes and then lunchtime. Usually at lunchtime, I have 3 hours of break that will include me to take a sleep and then take a bath and then getting ready from the afternoon until the evening. Yeah, it's also full of classes. 

speaker A
08:21
How many classes do you have? Usually? Auto day? 

speaker B
08:26
In a day, we're done 123-45, 67, 89, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 prompt 40 classes? Yeah, because classes are like 15 minutes, 30 minutes. So let's say nine to 915, 915 to 939, 30 to ten. So because of the 15 minutes classes, so you can really grab a lot. And usually the classes that I have morally are 15 minutes. So that's why there's a lot of count in a day. 

speaker A
09:28
Even if the classes were 15 minutes long, you have to work. You have to work at least 10 hours a day in your life. 

speaker B
09:47
Working classes, is that 10 hours? 

speaker A
09:50
Yes, it's 10 hours. 

speaker B
09:56
Before. Actually, the good thing nowadays, this few months, I have breaks from lunchtime till like say, for example, from 01:00 p.m. To one to two to three to four, no Korea time, that's two to 05:00 p.m. Before I really have straight classes. Like I handle 50 classes in a day. Since that time, there were a few teachers can handle, but this time we have a lot of extra teachers. So I can loosen up my schedule and give it to new teachers. Including the weekend, I still also have classes, but I'm trying to make my weekend really free because that's my time to be relaxed. So far, including the weekend, that's going to be a total of 45 classes. 

speaker A
11:02
Is it okay to handle those classes? 

speaker B
11:11
Actually, even there are also other teachers who are for example, they are really home based job. I think two or three of my teachers who are parents, they are mothers, I think they have same number of students with me. That is why I can handle a lot of classes, because I am full time home based job. So there's really no hindrance for me to accept any number of students. And I can manage together with those few teachers who are also having the same number of classes with me. We can handle and organize our time not complicating things. It's really not easy to handle classes continuously because you will say sometimes there are times I will be late for the next class. 

speaker B
12:17
That is really happening. But as time passes by organizing organizing and sorting things out how to manage your time well so that's already the secret there. But it's not really actually tiring. As long as I just have a good sleep, even I sleep at night at around twelve midnight, then I wake up at 05:45. A.m. Yes. How many hours of sleep is that? Kind of like 5 hours. 

speaker A
13:04
Seems somewhat later for me these days I slept around 12:00. I don't know why. I used to slept 6 hours a day when I was going to work to commute I have to get about six these days. I don't have to commute this winter. I want to reduce some sleep these days, but I can't. 

speaker B
13:46
You cannot. But actually these sleeping hours, 5 hours is not healthy. Especially at my age. But I got used to it already. But if I'm still I feel sleepy. I really don't continue classes because it will just affect my how can I say if I will do classes and very variously I actually don't push on doing classes because it seems to be that my brain is not working. 

speaker A
14:26
What do you mean that you don't continue classes? 

speaker B
14:30
Especially like when I wake up in the morning there are really few times that when I wake up in the morning my eyes are still heavy, just still want to sleep. There are really few it just only happened a few times. I just canceled my classes and of course schedule a makeup class. So I don't push myself if I'm still really very sleepy. But anyways, we don't have enough much time. I will see you tomorrow on the article about cash less payment. Okay? 

speaker A
15:14
Okay. 

speaker B
15:16
You have a great weekend Monday. 

speaker A
15:19
Have a nice day too. 

speaker B
15:20
Bye bye. 

speaker A
15:36
You're very humorous.
