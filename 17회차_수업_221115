speaker B
00:15
Okay, I think you have tomorrow is going to be your last class. Do you plan to register for more classes? 

speaker C
00:22
I'm gonna extend it. 

speaker B
00:26
Yes. Okay. 

speaker A
00:32
Anyways. 

speaker B
00:35
Wait, I'm just going to open what's going to be our article this morning? 

speaker C
00:39
One about mosquitoes. 

speaker B
00:45
The mosquitoes. Okay, just going to open that one. Mosquitoes study. Our smells make us mosquito magnets. All right. What are your thoughts on this study? 

speaker C
01:14
I have heard about the fact that the insects are very good at smell something. 

speaker B
01:26
Pardon me again. Mosquitoes. 

speaker C
01:30
Insects are good at smell. 

speaker B
01:35
Okay. So kind of like they can easily let's just say insects can easily be attracted to any smell. 

speaker C
01:46
Yes, they can smell very well so that they can smell the CO2 we breathe out so that they can find us very well. 

speaker B
02:07
I think for me, fly that small flies, usually they are the ones who are more attracted to meats and smelly foods. You know those fly. 

speaker C
02:24
Yeah, I know. 

speaker B
02:26
That really irritates me because there was this kind of like YouTube video. No, it wasn't a YouTube video, but just a video that came up on my Facebook news feed. You know, it's a video showing to be careful with flies that once they land, there are a lot of bacteria that they produce. They left, they leave. Like when they get on your food or anything, there are already dirt or bacteria. They are living. So kind of like yucks. Yeah, it's easy here, actually, in our house, especially frying fish. Frying dried fish or anchovies. Flies are easily attracted with that snow. 

speaker C
03:23
They can smell and they see on everything. 

speaker B
03:34
Exactly. There are really characteristics of insects that they only can detect. Not with us. What insect annoys you the most, Mueller? Insects that annoys you? 

speaker C
03:57
Do you know the tiny flies which swarms nearby the river or something? 

speaker B
04:11
Insects on the river? Grasshoppers? No. 

speaker C
04:18
Grasshoppers? No. Little bugs. Fruit flies. What is that, Ethan? May fly. Day fly? Yeah, day fly. 

speaker B
04:42
Dayfly. D-A-Y. Fly? 

speaker C
04:45
Yes. 

speaker B
04:50
Hold on. May fly. This one. Wait. 

speaker C
05:07
Maybe yes. I used to learn about three to 5 day when I was junior in university. I used to learn deliver side. And whenever I learn, there always are some Mayfi they follow 

speaker C
06:08
me. 

speaker B
06:08
I don't know why they follow me. 

speaker C
06:11
They follow me. 

speaker B
06:13
Maybe we're smell. No, I mean not the smell that you smell stink. Maybe your sweat or we really have this regular we don't smell bad, but there's really our smell that attracts them. That humans cannot notice that smell. But only insects can. 

speaker C
06:35
Maybe. But. 

speaker B
06:39
Who knows? Maybe ascent from your usual. Sometimes I can because we wash up on the nighttime before going to bed. Soaps absorb in our body. So when we swept, there is still also a smell. So maybe they followed you because of some smell. They liked you, the insect like you. 

speaker C
07:05
I tried to learn from them, but they follows me. 

speaker B
07:11
You try to run away from them. Okay. Usually when you try running when you're jugging or running okay. 

speaker C
07:27
It is very annoying that they usually float around my height. And I used to pump with them. 

speaker B
07:49
When I learned like they are also like meet you. 

speaker C
07:57
And there were some times that I because I don't use any masks when I learn I used to have some of them in my mouth sometimes. 

speaker B
08:19
Oh, sometimes? Sometimes insects will get in those small insects will get in our eyes. You should be careful about that. We don't know that those insects are not saved. How does the insect taste when it cuts into your mouth? 

speaker C
08:42
They are super annoying. 

speaker B
08:46
Okay. Are you generally frightened of insects? Well, there are a lot of insects. Really? Are you generally frightened about them or just they're just there. 

speaker C
09:06
Ones that are smooth more I'm okay with them and I used to kill them with tissues. But if they are a bit bigger than maybe. 

speaker B
09:28
My name maybe cockroach or. 

speaker C
09:33
Bugs yes, I frightened. 

speaker B
09:39
Me. I really I can say until now even one cockroach. It terrifies me. I have phobia with that way back when I was little, while I was sleeping on our living room before just get a pillow, put on your living room. Just lie down on the floor while watching animation. That time I was still, I think twelve or 13 while lying on the floor, an insect got in my ears. It wasn't that big, but it was a medium size of cockroach. My mom brought me to a doctor. Good thing there was a doctor in the town because I was already crying. 

speaker B
10:42
Like it's really hurting me already. So my mom didn't realize what was that? But she can see on her flashlight. It's something. But she didn't realize it was a cockroach. She tried putting some oil so that I'll put like that. So it will just go out. But it doesn't it's even getting going inside. So my mom brought me to a doctor. And then doctors have these special lights to deep see your ears. So she found out it was a cockroach. Lucky that it wasn't big. I don't know what kind of liquid did that doctor put, but it's a liquid that killed the cockroach. It was like after 45 minutes, the doctor asked if I still can feel movement even though I was in pain. But I just said just pull it out. So yes, it was pulled out. 

speaker B
11:39
But there were legs of the scarcroach it sucked into inside my ear. Lucky that not that much wood left on my ears. But because if it will happen, if there were too much damage inside, I can't hear. But actually for a week I cannot hear from my right ears that time. So even now, even one cockroach I cry out like there's a 911 emergency because it treats me. 

speaker C
12:16
How's your ear now? 

speaker B
12:20
It's fine already. After a week, I can hear back slowly again. So it means to say the doctor said the wound is already healing, so I don't need to worry that time because the doctor said it wasn't really that big damage because it was a small cockroach. So the small cockroach just have small legs. Lucky that it wasn't a big cockroach, because if it was a big cockroach, then legs are bigger. So when this room was made, my husband really made sure that especially well, mosquito is a very small one. That's fine. They can really get in. But make sure that a cockroach, especially a cockroach, cannot get in this room because it really terrifies me. I cry like somebody died or somebody's killing me, something like that. 

speaker B
13:22
I can never overcome this kind of fear. 

speaker C
13:28
I'm that kind of problem. OOH, I have POPIA on. Caterpillar. 

speaker B
13:39

speaker C
13:40

speaker B

speaker B
13:47

speaker C
13:51

speaker B
13:56
