speaker A
00:01
Didn't do it again. 

speaker B
00:11
I think I'm somewhat selfish because if I throw out some blood from my body, my body needs to compensate the blood. I need energy and I have to last for a while and that makes me feel like that doesn't help me. 

speaker A
01:02
But that time you were qualified to Denise blood, right? Because they're still going to test you. I was curious, how does it feel? Did you feel dizzy after getting blood? 

speaker B
01:20
What do you call it? I have some kind of anemia. When I do squat, when I lift very heavy weight, I feel some kind of disease and feel that after donating the blood, I didn't feel any kind of dizziness. Don't worry about that. 

speaker A
02:17
I think I am scared is because I have, how can I say phobia on injections. But during the vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine, I have overcome from it, but not yet. Totally. 

speaker B
02:37
Do you have carnivophopia in injection? 

speaker A
02:42
Like, you know, the needle, the needle itself? 

speaker B
02:52
I want to hear the reason why you decided to donate the blood. 

speaker A
03:01
I really want it. Ever since I guess two years ago, I had already my strong eagerness to donate blood. I'm scared, I'm nervous, but my strong eagerness and willingness to donate blood because I can help, who knows? I can save people from my blood. Just really no other reason. My strong willingness and urge to donate blood is there. Even though I know there will be. Like I'm scared and nervous. I know this is just a little thing, but I know I can do this. Just really no certain reason, I just really want to donate blood. My husband just stopped me because he said oh, you're not qualified because you have a tattoo. But actually my tattoo is not that big and the cousin of my husband also deleted, but she has a tattoo. 

speaker A
04:07
And then my husband said no, you're not qualified. I said, why would I not be qualified? So it was actually my husband that bothers me not to always I attempt to attend but I back out because my husband says no, you're not qualified. But this time I found out that you can donate blood as long as you're not doing any medication. You're not a smoker, you're not a drinker, like drinking every day, you're not anemic. My mom and sister, they were rejected because they are anemic like you anemia. No other reason. Really I just wanted to meet you. 

speaker B
04:54
Studied the route and I think the reason why your husband say that you're not qualified because he loves you and he wants you to be taking care of you. 

speaker A
05:19
Yeah, I guess so. That's the reason. Because ever since I got vaccinated, I easily get sick. Even simple headache. Before that I rarely feel after I started getting the coffee 19 I easily get sick. Even simple headaches usually appears every now and then. It's really different. And of course, when I feel sick, even the smallest feeling of an easy body. I always tell him like, oh, I am like this, I feel like this. And he automatically, when he comes home, he usually brings me the medicine. So I guess he doesn't just want me to do whatever it is that I will feel after donating God. And actually I finally convinced him. I told him Saturday, Saturday, Sunday. I talked to him like, I want to donate blood. And he said no. 

speaker A
06:20
He still said no. I said it's going to be okay, I think, because as far as I talked to people who experienced blood donations, let's see, out of them that I asked, only one said he felt a little bit busy after donating God. But the dissonance didn't take long, it was just short. And then I found out those things to be qualified. And everyone is saying it's positive, I mean, positive feedback. They didn't feel anything. Then my husband says okay. And I said to him, I will still be checked if I will be qualified to donate blood or not. So then finally he said okay. 

speaker B
07:14
When I donated the blood, the people in the hospital, a kind of hospital hospital took care of me very well. They bring me some drink water and snacks to compensate the amount of energy I spent. 

speaker A
07:43
Do they think? 

speaker B
07:44
Yes. 

speaker A
07:46
How many minutes did it take for you to donate one bag of the blood? 

speaker B
07:54
It is two to three years before ago. I don't remember exactly mine, but maybe 15 minutes to 20, I think. 

speaker A
08:12
So actually, the blood lapping, it's all community activity here. It's the birthday of my auntie, who is the town leader here. He's the sister of my mom. So she is celebrating her birthday for the people. She is conducting COVID vaccinations, free medical services, consultations and free medicines, free feeding program for the kids, giving free sleepers for the kids, blood letting. So right now, today, in the morning, she will be having that celebration with the people, with the town. I will go there early morning. So that actually it starts 09:00 A.m. To eleven. So it was split on my schedule. So maybe at 930, it's still not crowded, so I can go there. 

speaker A
09:15
And I will be prioritized to get the first line too. I'm scared and a little bit nervous. 

speaker B
09:28
In a walking distance? 

speaker A
09:30
Yeah, just walking distance. Actually, if I'm going to ride a motorcycle or a bicycle, it's just five minutes. 

speaker B
09:45
So you go there and donate blood like this. And who conduct the event is your mother's sister? 

speaker A
10:00
Yeah, my auntie. 

speaker B
10:01
Auntie. 

speaker A
10:03
It's her birthday. 

speaker B
10:07
She do these kind of events once a year when it's her birthday. 

speaker A
10:17
Not really, because before it was two years ago, it was called 19. So no, there was nothing like this before. The Pandami, she usually celebrates her birthday both in the office and with the family. And this time she's celebrating it for the people. With the people of this town. So by giving medical services. 

speaker B
10:56
Yeah. 

speaker A
10:56
Actually in this town, we are very known. Our family is very known here. Because of my grandfather, the father of my mom. He has been a town leader here for 30 years. Because he was really a good person. He just wants this town to be peaceful. So the one who followed his footsteps in politics is my auntie. Right now, aunty, how do you call it in Korea? Let's say the sister of your mom. 

speaker B
11:42
I think emo is auntie. Yes, my mother's sister. 

speaker A
11:46
Yes, emo and brother. 

speaker B
11:49
And brother is will sam tone. 

speaker A
11:53
Okay. I'm going to say emu. That was the thing. I prefer the emo. Okay. Excited? Nervous? I'll be fine. 

speaker B
12:12
Fighting. And I'm so impressed about your auntie. She's doing very great jobs for the community. Wow. 

speaker A
12:28
The son of my auntie is actually the bloodletting is from the cities. A city government has this branch of offices. Right? So the son of my auntie is also the department head of the blood Lapping office in our whole city. So we are sure the next thing that will follow my auntie's footstep will be her son. So it's kind of like it's running in our blood. But it's just that it's our choice as a family relative. What we do is that it's not easy to be a politician. Because people will come to your house and ask any help. Right? We don't want to involve that. But during election and after election is our auntijuan. So we support any community activities. 

speaker A
13:33
Like every Saturday, there is an early morning cleaning up in the town to prevent sickness around the area. Just every morning Saturday, cleaning up the town. 

speaker B
13:45
Clean up town. Wow. 

speaker A
13:46
Great jobs. Everything along the highway, your area. So that no sickness. Especially that sickness that will give to children to clean up garbages, everything, water, drainage, it will all be cleaned up every Saturday. 

speaker B
14:07
Impressive. And you are participating on the job? 

speaker A
14:15
I am also one of the community leaders here. I am here. In my community, I am the leader. Yes. So whatever my auntie wants activities in order for this town to be clean and safe. So we follow. 

speaker B
14:38
These days, Korea don't have that kind of community. Once I was very young, we had that community. And I miss that. There's no that kind of thing. 

speaker A
15:01
Yeah. Actually, your government can actually do these kind of activities. Who knows? Especially booster. Why not bring the culvit vaccine to each town? Right? We call it actually medical services. Medical operations services. Free for people, free medical consultations, free services. And then for each town, it really depends on the kind of leader you have. If they are really concerned about your town to be a safer place to live, then they can really conduct activities that will clean up and make your town safer to live. It's kind of like also making your community cooperate and know each other. 

speaker B
15:48
Yes. I don't know the people who live next to me and see you tomorrow. Bye. Thanks. 

speaker A
16:03
Bye.
