Hi, Ned. 

speaker B
00:17
Morning. Wow, you also wake up early. Did you finish exercising? 

speaker A
00:25
Yes, I just finished. 

speaker B
00:30
That's good. Second day. Good. I will count until Friday. What's going to be our topic this morning? 

speaker A
00:45
It's about meditation. 

speaker B
00:48
The meditation, the mindfulness. Have you tried meditation? 

speaker A
00:57
Once I was in high school. I remember that I tried to do nothing for an hour and in my thought I did some kind of medication. 

speaker B
01:22
Okay. What do you make of the fact that anxiety has increased globally? 

speaker A
01:34
The main fact? 

speaker B
01:36
Yeah. What can you say about that? What can you say about the fact that anxiety is increasing globally? 

speaker A
01:50
I think one of the main reason is that the social media has gone so much that everyone uses it. And by using it, people think about that. People start comparing themselves and others in a way that the money they have, the things they have, where they are, where they live in and those compare those 

speaker A
02:53
comparisons. 

speaker B
03:10
What do you find makes you feel better when you are stressed? Anxious. 

speaker A
03:33
Medicine for anxiety, for a while. 

speaker B
03:38
Even until now. 

speaker A
03:42
I was prescribed, but I didn't have the medicine these days. 

speaker B
03:53
So the doctor prescribed you and then you were taking it before and not now anymore? 

speaker A
03:59
Not now anymore. Because I think I am okay without the medicine now. 

speaker B
04:10
What makes you anxious? 

speaker A
04:14
Those kind of big events like getting out of work and be sued by X Company. As I said before, social media and the medicine actually hurt me. But it is not that dramatic. And it has society packs too? Yes. Like some kind of cute stuff like this. 

speaker A
05:19
Can you see them? 

speaker B
05:21
What is that? 

speaker A
05:25
So when I get depressed, I usually buy some kind of things that would make me happier. And I think it is helpful to take a shower in a cold water. 

speaker B
05:49
It is helpful for you. Is it the feeling of like something's flushed away from you. 

speaker A
06:03
That works too bad. When I take shower in a cold water, I feel freezing and I do something I cannot expect for me to do some kind of action that I usually jump. I usually jump a lot and make some noises that basically just jump. Yeah, when I take shower because it's too cold to just standing. 

speaker B
06:44
It'S too cold when you're just standing there. Okay. 

speaker A
06:48
And I've been around a lot and that makes me happier. That movement, that noise that I cannot expect makes me hilarious. That kind of makes me hilarious and makes me happier. 

speaker B
07:10
Okay. That's why I'm getting fat. Because whenever I'm stressed, eat and eating the quickest way for me to relieve from sudden I mean, every day we really have I call it a normal stress, but once there's an added stress, that's already a different story. So I just want to get out from that extra stress right away. So eating really relieves me right away from being stressed. Like, you know, that feeling after eating like, okay, I'm good. 

speaker A
07:45
Actually. I cannot how do you call it? Empathy. 

speaker B
07:56
You cannot empathize sympathy? 

speaker A
07:59
Yeah. 

speaker B
08:00
Sympathize. 

speaker A
08:01
I cannot agree with that. I have that a lot. I have seen some girls and numerous who feels better when they eat. They said that when they get stressed, they eat snacks, chocolates and things, that it makes them happier. 

speaker B
08:36
Yeah, but the thing with me is that every time I'm stressed, I eat in return. It's a bad effect on my body. I'm getting fat. So that's also the bad effect. I'm actually planning I'm quite thinking already this past few days because I'm not happy with my body anymore. It's kind of like I'm getting fatter, I'm overweight, I need to do something. As I'm getting older, I have to do something. I'm quite been thinking this past days, it's giving me a little headache to decide to go to the gym from next year. There's a nearest gym from my town and I know my husband will be okay with it because before he already said that he's okay with the gym. But I need to visit the facility first if it's the environment, the personal trainer, so I'm planning to visit it first and let's 

speaker B
09:44
see. But I really want at least doing it every day, not to affect my job. So I guess after lunch I can go. 

speaker A
09:57
However, how about other exercise? Like badminton or swimming? 

speaker B
10:07
I'm not into swimmington. I don't have anybody to play badminton with and the town is not having any I don't have any space here or anyone that I know now playing badminton and if it is usually before here in the town, the badminton games are done in the evening, like after work. So like eight to five. So when people who place badminton arrive from work, they do it 06:00. So it's disturbing my job already. So I guess going to the gym from next year will be fine. Not the muscle toning or heavy exercises, but at least everyday sweating and let's say staying fit. At my age, he 

speaker B
11:09
said yes. 

speaker A
11:13
Have you ever tried to go to the gym for exercise? 

speaker B
11:19
Yeah, two months or three months before I got married, I went to the gym. I think it was every day too. 

speaker A
11:33
Because it is somewhat boring to going to the gym and exercise there. Although I have been exercising for more than a couple of years, it is some kind of boring tiring thing to do exercises. 

speaker B
11:57
Yeah, it is. That's why I want to visit first. The facility. It's just a nearby, it's not really in the city. I'm planning to visit it after Christmas. The facility seeing and checking the environment, if it's okay, if it's healthy, not inconvenient. Yeah, it depends. But the excitement is there to stay fit. It's going to be hard for especially in the first days, weeks. That's going to be hard for me. Hopefully my motivation will be it's really going to be a hard enemy for me when I start. 

speaker A
12:44
And when do you plan to go to the gym? In the morning? 

speaker B
12:51
After lunch. 

speaker A
12:52
After lunch? 

speaker B
12:54
After lunch? Like around Philippine time. That's 01:00 here. So please go in there. And then at least I can be back. Including the transportation back and forth. So like one Philippine time at least I will arrive here before 04:00 to get ready for another set of classes. So I will make sure that my after lunch some next year will be available to give way for my plan. I actually bought some exercising equipment. My husband bought me yoga mat before. But it's not working. 

speaker A
13:40
And I have a question. Why did you plan to go to the gym from next year, not next month? 

speaker B
13:51
It's useless to start it next month. December christmas is coming. A lot of activities, a lot of family gatherings. And how can I say when I start exercising? It's reducing your eating habits, right? It's included, so there's a lot of parties from the family. So I can't prevent that. So I better start it from next year. After Christmas, I plan to visit the facility. Yeah, I got it. At least from January road to my birthday. April will be a good thing. It's a gift for myself. 

speaker A
14:35
Great. 

speaker B
14:37
At least when I turn 40 years old on April next year, I'll be fit. We don't have enough much time. Let's continue tomorrow. Okay? 

speaker A
14:47
Hi. Bye. 

speaker B
14:50
Don't sleep anymore. 

speaker A
14:51
Okay. 

speaker B
14:53
Bye.
