Hi, Russ. 

speaker B
00:11
Morning. Can you clearly see me? 

speaker A
00:14
Yes, I can see you. 

speaker B
00:20
Strict this morning. 

speaker A
00:23
It's about cons. 

speaker B
00:30
Okay. How strict is what can you say? What are your thoughts on this article? That obviously we know that in America it's easy for people to it's too liberated to bring guns, right? So what are your thoughts on this? 

speaker A
00:58
I think it is owner nothing problem. I think if the government choose to decide to accept people holding some guns if they decided to do that, I think they shouldn't. It just how the USA does. Am I saying? Right? I think the USA is doing well. 

speaker B
02:05
You mean to say? 

speaker A
02:07
Because I think that if the government choose to allow people holding guns, there should be some kind of restriction for sure. 

speaker B
02:30
But mostly in America it's really illegal possession of firearms. Really illegal. Mostly I think in America kind of like these reality TV shows or even this crime documents I see guns when they found out a gun shooting in a house. Usually guns are illegal possession. Because I think in America there are gun stores too. I think in a gun store it doesn't matter if you buy a gun, if you have a permit or not. I think that's a problem in America. They are not too strict to ownership of cons. How many shooting incident or mass shooting massacre incident in America this year? 

speaker B
03:33
I think there were a lot killing innocent children, right? 

speaker A
03:42
I thought that if everyone heard gun, it might be kind of restriction for each other that I cannot people think that I should be careful. 

speaker B
04:08
I should be careful. 

speaker A
04:10
I should be careful. Alice, I don't know how to say this in English. If I shoot him, he shoot me. 

speaker B
04:29
Two do you think nobody you don't know in America? Who knows? Let's just say you're in that community, who knows? All of them are just really having guns. You don't know who's right. You don't know who you are facing to. 

speaker A
04:48
And I think that is like regulation. If the government choose to allow some people hold the guns in Korea, it is illegal to have guns and it is very hard to get a license for a gun. Having gun. 

speaker B
05:19
I love it in Korea. It's very strict when it comes to drugs and guns. Okay. 

speaker A
05:34
I think it is a problem of all of nothing. Or people should have guns. Or people should not have guns. 

speaker B
05:46
Should not have guns. Because let's say just example where is this article? Just for example, we all have different characteristics and behaviors, right? 

speaker A
05:59
Yes. 

speaker B
06:00
So there are many people also that are short tempered. When they get angry, they became violent. There are also people who get angry, but they just do it in the other way around. So what if there are these people who are short tempered and just use violent hold on. Sorry. My husband is going to work. Okay. Yeah. So what is that case. 

speaker A
06:45
I thought that if the show tempered one has guns, I should have one too. 

speaker B
06:57
It's kind of like yours is I for an eye, tooth for tooth and. 

speaker A
07:02
If he doesn't have one, I should not have one too. That's why I said or nothing. Because I have to have some ways to protect me against him. 

speaker B
07:23
To protect myself against him. 

speaker A
07:26
Protect myself from him. 

speaker B
07:29
Against him. 

speaker A
07:30
Against him if he has guns. 

speaker B
07:36
Have you ever hold a gun already? 

speaker A
07:39
What? 

speaker B
07:40
Have you ever hold a gun? 

speaker A
07:42
No. 

speaker B
07:44
I was in the military. 

speaker A
07:45
During the military? Yes, I had. I thought about how they call that handgun. But in the military I have some long guns. I do not care in English. 

speaker B
08:06
Long guns. 

speaker A
08:08
There are some kind of guns, right? Handgun and lifu. Yes. And I had lyifu in the military. 

speaker B
08:27
Okay. So during the military, that was your first time to hold a gun, am I right? 

speaker A
08:33
Sure. Yes. 

speaker B
08:35
Were you not scared for the first time holding a gun? Like many thoughts running in your mind like, oh my God, I can do this. Oh my God, this is a gun. Something like that. 

speaker A
08:44
Yeah, sure. I had that. I was a pride of shooting it because about shooting a gun in the military and I was waiting for my shooting and the sound of the gun fire who was in front of me was so loud I thought some kind of cannon was there. And he is very afraid of shooting one. 

speaker A
09:50
Even though I had some protection for my ears, it was true that I kind of felt some pain in my ear. So the guns are so. 

speaker B
10:19
What? Just a curious it's a strict law inquiry about guns. Do you have an idea? What if a person is caught carrying a gun? What will be the punishment? 

speaker A
10:37
Punishment? Carrying a gun for illegal. I don't know. 

speaker B
11:02
You don't know? Maybe what? Go to jail. What is that? 

speaker A
11:08
Maybe going to jail. 

speaker B
11:12
For two years or something. 

speaker A
11:16
Or months, maybe five years. 

speaker B
11:22
Okay. What country? For sure? Yes. I can consider I can mention korea is one of safe country in a way of being strict to gun handling. So what other countries do you think is safe when it comes to gun handling? 

speaker A
11:53
Japan, I think I happened to I haven't heard about some kind of incident with guns in Japan. So I think it is safe place against caught fires. 

speaker B
12:24
Great. Japan? 

speaker A
12:25
Yes. 

speaker B
12:28
Do you think Japan is also strict like Korea when it comes to gun handling? 

speaker A
12:36
Yes, I think even there are some kind of mafias in there called Yakuja. Yes, I think it is a flag from compilers. 

speaker B
12:58
Okay. What are the most controversial law right now in Korea or recently? Or what are the most controversial law in Korea right now or recently being talked about by people? 

speaker A
13:25
I have thought about one, but I can tell you about it. 

speaker B
13:38
Why? Okay, that's all right. 

speaker A
13:49
How about Philippines. Is there any strong restriction about hurting a gun? Having a gun? 

speaker B
13:59
It's really legal here in the Philippines. But I think it's not really strictly implemented like Korea does. Because it's still a big question. Why criminals? How can criminals carry guns and have guns? People who doesn't have any permit to carry guns, but they have guns. Guns at their home, guns in their car. Mostly illegal possession of firearms. So it's very illegal here in the Philippines. But I don't know why. These guns are just criminals. Mostly carries it. Drug dealers usually guns also are related to drug dealers or drug issues. I don't know if police are secretly involved in giving guns to criminals. I still don't get the answer about it. And we also don't have enough time. 

speaker B
15:02
Let's continue tomorrow with another topic I sent you this morning. Okay? 

speaker A
15:06
Okay. Bye, guys. 

speaker B
15:09
Bye.
