speaker A
00:00
I do a class with her at 715 Korea time. So she wakes up like 1 hour ahead to travel to the swimming area and then change and then go to the office. I'm kind of like, isn't it cool to be in the water early morning? 

speaker B
00:28
And this is winter time. Let me go. 

speaker A
00:34
But I am curious. You changed your gym. What gym do you really like? 

speaker B
00:48
I especially like squat, which means you lift some weight on your shoulder and you sit down and sit down and get up. This is called and I like this exercise. But to do so, to lift much weight, I need a safety bar beside me had gone. 

speaker A
01:43
It was not there anymore. 

speaker B
01:45
Yeah, there was no, maybe they removed it. Yeah, they removed the safety box. I don't know. Why. 

speaker A
02:03
Did you ask? Why was it? 

speaker B
02:06
No. Because there was no staff there in the morning, so I couldn't. 

speaker A
02:18
Okay. So finally, are you final with a new gym you just recently found or you will still look and check other gyms? 

speaker B
02:32
I decided to go to the gym I saw this morning. I went this morning. 

speaker A
02:43
One of the gym you just decided that gym this morning, is it just near walking distance? 

speaker B
02:52
Yes, in a walking distance. Maybe less than five minutes. 

speaker A
03:02
Just a walking okay. And other than that, what else happened? Or any something news during the weekend? Korean Air. It's the hottest news that crashed in the Philippines. Have we known? 

speaker B
03:22
No. 

speaker A
03:23
I did a Korean airplane, korean Air overshoot in one of the airport in the Philippines at around 03:00 A.m.. 

speaker B
03:37
What. 

speaker A
03:38
Is the I think they didn't land properly. It is still under investigation. But when I read some articles this morning, supposedly that airplane should land in one of the biggest airport in the Philippines. But because of the weather, I don't know why it's still not stated why. It just landed in Sebus airport. The investigation is still going on. It overshoot. So let's say this is the runway. It's landed there. It's blocking the runway. 

speaker B
04:19
Yes. 

speaker A
04:23
So that's the hottest news nowadays today. Because it happened at 03:00 a.m. 03:00 a.m Korea time. 03:00 a.m. Around 02:00 a.m Philippine time. The important thing is nobody was hurt. Nobody was injured. The plane was just damaged. As what I've known, the passengers in the crews were accommodated and were brought to where they were medically checked. And then they were accompanied to a hotel where they can stay near the airport. 

speaker B
05:02
Wow, that is a big use. 

speaker A
05:07
First thing in the morning when I woke up. Really? When I opened my phone, bang. There's all Korean air. It's really a Korean air? Yeah. I think Korean Air will send another plane to carry on to bring the passengers to their right destination. But I don't know how they can land. Because for now, that the airport. The Macan airport is not no plane can land. No plane can leave. Because the runway is blocked. 

speaker B
05:42
Big accident. 

speaker A
05:44
Yeah, it's a big accident. You see it now? 

speaker B
05:49
Maybe I googled it now. 

speaker A
05:54
Yeah, it's a Korean air. When was the last time you were on the plane? 

speaker B
06:11
When I was in high school? Yes, maybe I was at that time. 17, I think. I went to USA. You know what? I have been to Philippines, too. 

speaker A
06:40
When was that? Did you stay here for long? 

speaker B
06:43
Months. I stayed there. 

speaker A
06:48
Did you study English? 

speaker B
06:49
Yes, for studying English. And the CD was not sebu, but starts with C. 

speaker A
07:02
But it wasn't. 

speaker B
07:11
Manila. It starts with C. 

speaker A
07:21
Not in Cebu. 

speaker B
07:23
No, not Cebu. Cavite. 

speaker A
07:26
Manila. It's in Luzon, Cavite. Mananila is the capital city of the Philippines, but naturally but it's in Luzon. It's near Manila city, cavite. If I am correct, Cavit is one of the city. Yeah, one of the city in the Philippines, which is located in Luzon. Was there an English academy there? 

speaker B
08:08
No, I studied in the buildings of Coffee University and I learned English from the students of the university. 

speaker A
08:21
You didn't really purposely came to the Philippines to English Academy, but you went to school in Kabita University? 

speaker B
08:31
It's somewhat hard to explain, but yes, and I learned some catalogues, too. 

speaker A
08:41
What is it? 

speaker B
08:44
Two of them? I know two. Is Gamstaka. 

speaker A
08:53
Yeah, it's in English. How are you? 

speaker B
08:56
Yeah, gaussian kita kids. 

speaker A
09:00
Kitakids is kind of like in English. See you soon. See you later. Something like that. You didn't learn about Magan Dang? 

speaker B
09:09
Umagha I haven't heard about it. What is that. 

speaker A
09:16
Is good morning. 

speaker B
09:17
Magandang umaka that's good morning. Good morning. Yeah. 

speaker A
09:23
And then marami salamat is what you say? 

speaker B
09:27
Thank you, madami. Salamat. Bye. 

speaker A
09:36
Let's just say the very common Filipino words that foreigners must learn. The basic. 

speaker B
09:51
Is there an issued version of the. 

speaker A
09:57
Macantamagno? But actually Sebu and where I live, we don't speak Tagalog. I mean, Tagalog is not our language. Our language is we call it Visaya. 

speaker B
10:11
Visa. 

speaker A
10:13
So generally in the Philippines, it's not just one language. There is the Daglo, the visaya and the Mananao. 

speaker B
10:21
What is the difference between the languages? Is it the region? Because Philippines has so many islands. 

speaker A
10:30
Region mostly in Luzon. Because Philippines has three major islands. Luzon visayas mundanao. Luzon is the first biggest island. Visayas, where Sebu is, is the second biggest island. And then my third island is Mindanao, where mostly Mahanas or Muslims live here. Then mostly foreigners knew that. What they know is we speak Tagalog. No, but the people living in Saboo and My region, we can speak Tagalog. We can understand Tagalog. But people speaking, like from Cavity, from Luzon, they can speak Tagalog, but they cannot understand our language. But when foreigners come, naturally, we speak the English. 

speaker B
11:33
Then you can speak maybe more than four languages. 

speaker A
11:40
I can speak our language. Visaya. I can speak Tagalog. I can speak English, but I cannot speak madana. I don't know that's. Only three languages? Yes. So wherever I go in the Philippines, I can understand whatever their language is. 

speaker B
11:58
I didn't know that the Philippines has so many languages. 

speaker A
12:03
They're also people from Illocos. Their language is Elongo. 

speaker B
12:10
Elongo. 

speaker A
12:12
I think in Korea, in Jeju, if you're in Daglo, you have different accents or what is that? Something like it's not really all Korean, right? There is a different here. There's Mananao there's ilango. There is Tagalog. There's Visaya. So kind of like, every region mostly has their own language. But Tagalog can be understood in English by everyone. 

speaker B
12:44
So difference is not only accent, but the language. Right? The language is different. 

speaker A
12:52
Like Elongo. How do I know about Elongo? The accent of Elong. People from Ello is like, how can I say? Yeah, the longbow language is really difficult for me. Something like that. It's hard, actually, if you're just going to be mainly in Manila, Daglo, if you're in Cebu, Visaya, or you can also speak Daglo there in English, because the Buenos people from Cebu are very flexible when it comes to language. We can understand Tagalog. We can speak Tagalog. We can speak English. We can understand English. Yeah. Now you know the different languages of babies. Yeah. 

speaker A
13:55
Oh, my goodness. Now you know. But anyway, we don't have that much time. 

speaker B
14:00
Maybe kita kit. 

speaker A
14:03
I'll keep the kids. 

speaker B
14:05
Bye.
