Early today. 

speaker B
00:02
I woke up at around six and as I always do and I walk abolish, I do the exercise. 

speaker A
00:18
Okay? I do. I hope it will not change everything. 

speaker B
00:22
I hope the too. 

speaker A
00:28
How was your weekend so far? 

speaker B
00:31
What did I do? I haven't done anything interesting. Actually, I was to take an exam on last Saturday. But I was upon it because I'm not ready to take the exam. 

speaker A
01:01
What exam is that? 

speaker B
01:02
Exam of certificate. 

speaker A
01:10
For employment. What is that for? 

speaker B
01:12
It. 

speaker A
01:17
So you can say you're not yet ready yet. That's why you postponed it. Okay. And tonight it's going to be another game for Korea. 

speaker B
01:29
I'm not interested in. 

speaker A
01:33
My students are almost already absent for tonight. 

speaker B
01:40
How about you? Do you interested in any sports? 

speaker A
01:43
Am I? No. I even don't know about soccer. Because soccer is not a famous game here in Korea. In Philippines, basketball is the famous game here in the Philippines. Soccer and not really knowledgeable. Last Thursday, I just happened to watch the game. Because mostly my students at night absent because of the game. Knowing also tonight, since yesterday, they already sent me a message that they can make a class tonight because of the game. So I used to play volleyball when I was in high school and had been done. But after the school days, I was never involved in sports. I'm not a sports minded, but Korea has gone. 

speaker B
02:49
Me neither. 

speaker A
02:52
So you're not going to be one of those that will watch tonight? 

speaker B
02:55
I'm not interested in at all. I don't like soccer. I don't know why. Many of my friends love watching and playing soccer. But I'm not. 

speaker A
03:12
Mostly Koreans do love or watch support soccer game. Okay. Anyway, that's going to be our topic for this morning. 

speaker B
03:28
I have that about quiet quitting. 

speaker A
03:31
Quiet quitting? Quiet quitting. Hold on. Everything you need to know about quiet quitting. 

speaker B
03:43
Yes. 

speaker A
03:46
Okay. I'm just going to opening. So what are your thoughts on this article? 

speaker B
04:01
I have noticed that in this article it introduced quiet trading as culture, some kind of culture in work places. But I thought that as I quit the company I work for yeah, I worked for. I have searched it a lot about quitting the job. And I have some article, some writings about quiet kidding. And in that article, in that lighting, they introduced quiet kicking as a stage where someone is getting ready to 

speaker B
05:11
move to another company. And I know that is some kind of difference between those article I read and this article. In this article, it interests not as a stage but as some kind of culture for just a stage. Yes. 

speaker A
05:46
Okay. Your work before, would you describe your workplace as having a hustle culture? 

speaker B
06:01
Yes. 

speaker A
06:02
Why do you say so? 

speaker B
06:05
I used to work almost every day. Every work day for about eleven to 12 hours. So I had to work after junior. By the time when the subway station does not work anymore. So I think that's. 

speaker A
06:55
Okay. How many years have you been working in that company? 

speaker B
07:05
As I told you before, I have worked for my ex company for a year and a year, eight months. And as the company split it in two, I worked in three months. The company was split it. 

speaker A
07:32
Okay. During those one year and eight months, what was the changes you've noticed in the company? In your company, everything like changes. 

speaker B
07:44
What kind of changes do you make? 

speaker A
07:47
Word, block, environment, colleagues, everything. 

speaker B
07:54
When I first got in there, there was just about five people, five claims, including the CEO. But as time goes by, the people. 

speaker A
08:38
Does your job allow you to have a good work life, balance the time? 

speaker B
08:43
Not at all. 

speaker A
08:45
Not at all. 

speaker B
08:48
They pay me small but expected me to work harder, hard. I don't know why, but there was some kind of atmosphere that we should work more. I couldn't deny or reject the atmosphere. Everyone is rupee. So I had to work with them too. It is kind of I don't know the word again, it's yes. I had to have some kind of sense that to getting along with them. 

speaker A
09:59
To get along with them. So you mean to say you had a good relationship with your coworkers, right? Except for your boss? 

speaker B
10:16
Except I tried to, but they didn't sell me as a colleague, but gear for their company. 

speaker A
10:37
Say that again. They didn't saw me as colleagues. 

speaker B
10:45
Some kinds of machine. 

speaker A
10:50
They are not seeing you as their colleague at work, but instead just like a machine that they can just let's just say just on off something like that. 

speaker B
10:59
Yeah, they just take for granted that I work for them way more than I had to. 

speaker A
11:11
It's kind of like they are underestimating you, belittling you that yes, you are there working but as you said, just like as if you're not there. 

speaker B
11:22
Just like what? 

speaker A
11:24
Just like if you're not there because you don't exist for them. 

speaker B
11:31
Yes, now there's. 

speaker A
11:43
Okay. If there is one thing that you could have changed about your previous company what could that be? 

speaker B
11:59
The money I get. 

speaker A
12:03
The money you get? It wasn't enough, right? Didn't you manage to demand more? 

speaker B
12:18
There was some time to negotiate the pay as the new year starts in this year. But at that time I had to take some classes in the university. So they said that because you had to use your time to take those classes, the payment will not be late. 

speaker A
13:02
Okay, I got it. Now you are pursuing to work for another company, right? 

speaker B
13:12
Yes. 

speaker A
13:15
Any progress on that? 

speaker B
13:21
Not yet. I submitted paper. What kind of paper? 

speaker A
13:29
You mean to say resume? 

speaker B
13:31
Yeah, resume. I just sent one and one that was rejected and I'm now preparing for some certificates to express my skills. 

speaker A
13:49
And how about recommendation letter from the previous job? You can't have it. 

speaker B
13:55
I can't have it, but I didn't ask for that yet. 

speaker A
14:03
Okay, we also don't have enough much time, so let's continue tomorrow. Okay? Good job for this morning. You woke up early. I'll see you tomorrow. You move tomorrow. 

speaker B
14:18
Bye.
