That's gonna be our topic today, I guess. I sent you this more I forgot last night yesterday, to send you this articles about business. What article would you like to have. 

speaker B
00:14
Today as a free topic about poor day work week? 

speaker A
00:22
Do you have any idea or do you know that there is a certain country who is already doing this four day work? But it's not a law, but their company or worker can freely choose. 

speaker B
00:41
If. 

speaker A
00:41
They want a four day week. 

speaker B
00:43
I heard that one of the company of Korea named Neighbor is doing four day work week now. 

speaker A
00:56
Really? Like they are implementing it as their policy. 

speaker B
01:05
I heard it from a person, but I do not know that it's her company policy or just department policy. But they do. 

speaker A
01:20
Okay. What are your thoughts about these four working days automatically? Four working days, three days weekend. 

speaker B
01:32
Sometimes there were holiday between the weekdays and when I had one in weekdays, I feel better. And when I go to the work, I feel I was fully charged to work. But if there wasn't, if I had to go to the work five days a week, I felt that there wasn't enough time to get left or feel charged. 

speaker A
02:24
So kind of like the two weekends is not enough. You need more. 

speaker B
02:31
I needed three days of holiday. 

speaker A
02:36
You're going to be having a long weekend next week as we will not be making class Monday and Tuesday. 

speaker B
02:44
Why is that? 

speaker A
02:46
I didn't mention it to you yesterday. Either way, the company will release a notice. It's a big holiday here in the Philippines. October 31 and November 1. Naturally, we call it all Halloween days. But it's our Halloween. It's not like America Halloween party or something. No, because Filipinos are Catholic. Majorly. So in Korea, in Thanksgiving Day, you do chate, right? 

speaker B
03:18
Choreograph, right? 

speaker A
03:23
I don't know. I think my pronunciation is chate. So call it chate. In Korea, we do that. That's how I will describe it. What we do on October 31 and November 1, we visit our loved ones who passed away their grave or cemetery. We clean up. We prepare prayers. Family gathers prayers, foods. So typically, to make it understand more, we will be doing chatting. 

speaker B
03:55
How many days do you usually do? 

speaker A
04:00
Two days, actually. Two days in the Philippines in the calendar, it's not Halloween. It is All Souls Day. 

speaker B
04:11
All Saints Day. 

speaker A
04:16
It's one of the biggest aside from Christmas and New Year old Thursday and all. Wednesday is also the biggest holiday in the whole Philippines. 

speaker B
04:28
As a Catholic, the reason I asked you about the amount of days you last was usually in my country in Korea, when we have to do some kind of chow. Last three days. 

speaker A
04:53
I think actually the holiday here is actually in the Philippines is October 31, November 1 and November 2, actually. But I choose to do the October 31, November 1 and then November 2. I resume class. Because on those days I can meet my relatives and friends, do what I needed to do. Because I had a daughter before, but she passed away. Yeah. So there are things that I needed to do. Clean up or repair what is needed to be repaired on the cemetery. So two days is really in the Philippines for Charles. You call indagalog. They call it undas. 

speaker B
05:47
Undas? 

speaker A
05:48
Undas. I forgot to mention it to you yesterday. So yeah. Monday and Tuesday we won't be making any classes. But there are a few teachers that are not Catholic. I guess they won't just do class November 1, but mostly will not do classes. Especially if catholic. 

speaker B
06:26
They need to last like me. They need to last a day more than weekend. 

speaker A
06:36
Yeah. I also take the opportunity after doing what is needed to be done then November. So most likely I will take a rest and get ready to start again November 1. I mean mostly by November 1. I will just relax a little bit and then start preparing to start the class by November too. Yes, but don't worry. We will be giving notices within this week about the holiday. The management will be sending messages. 

speaker B
07:15
Okay. 

speaker A
07:17
Is that okay with you? 

speaker B
07:18
Yes, but I lost some words. What do you mean by the TSET? 

speaker A
07:32
What did they say? 

speaker B
07:36
You said we do not have some kind of TSET. I heard. No. 

speaker A
07:48
We don't have that kind of. 

speaker B
07:53
Reminding memories. That is short. Maybe I just remember remember and ask you about it later. 

speaker A
08:07
Yeah, you can just send me a message. 

speaker B
08:09
Okay. So what do you prefer? Do you prefer four day no, four day work week or five? 

speaker A
08:24
I guess four working days. It depends on the kind of job. Four working days. In my online job, five working days is fine. Because why? Because actually we're just at home. Maybe those who are working in the office most likely would be hungry or would go for four working days. But the thing there is that will salaries be affected if there will be only four working days? Let's say for example, five working days, your monthly income is $40,000. And let's just say it will be moved to four working days. So that $40,000. Will it be lesser? Right. Do you think salaries will be lesser if there will be a four working days only? 

speaker B
09:27
It depends on companies. 

speaker A
09:30
It depends on the company. 

speaker B
09:31
Yeah. 

speaker A
09:36
Because it's four working days. Let's just say the rate is just the same. But even if the rate is just the same but for working days, your salary will really be reduced, right? So it will affect your financial. What is this budget or status? Especially for a family man, right? 

speaker B
10:00
Yes, it's kind of dilemma. 

speaker A
10:09
Tell me, what are those advantages? You can see when there is a four working days and three weekends, there. 

speaker B
10:17
Might be maybe company can hire more people than they used to because they need 20% more work than before workers than before. So the higher rate would be increased. There will be some kind of person like me who prefer to work four days a week, and they will be happier than before. So there will be two major positive things, I think. 

speaker A
11:06
And if there will be four working days and three days weekend, it will give employees time for their family. 

speaker B
11:15
Right, right. And they can have time for some kind of hobby exercise, extra time to do their hobbies. 

speaker A
11:25
Not actually, it's true. Two weekends is too short because our lifestyle work styles have changed. So kind of like, we need more weekends to have we need more weekends. Kind of like Friday. Saturday, okay. You can enjoy Sunday. You have to do relaxing because it's. 

speaker B
11:49
A Monday again, I need a few days. 

speaker A
11:54
Yeah, it's kind of like, for example, your best friend invited you for Saturdays to party and drink, and then Sunday you have another invitation from your best friend. But you cannot because the next day is one day. 

speaker B
12:06
Yes. Actually, my colleagues said that, too. My colleagues said that she doesn't have any appointments. She tried not to have any appointment on Sunday because she had to prepare for work next day. The Monday. 

speaker A
12:28
That's also the thing with us online teachers. We cannot enjoy. Somebody will invite me for oh, it's a party like it's a birthday of their daughter. I have also cool teachers living in St Town. They are mothers. And sometimes they invite me for because it's the birthday of their daughter, of their children. But I cannot go because for sure, there will be drinking. So I cannot drink because the next day is a Monday. I have to wake up early. So it's kind of like irritating, too. 

speaker B
13:03
What? When is your time? 

speaker A
13:15
Monday to Friday. I always wake up at 05:45 A.m. Korea time, because my first class is 06:00 A.m.. 06:00 A.m.? 

speaker B
13:22
Wow. 

speaker A
13:25
Midnight. 

speaker B
13:26
Who is that? 

speaker A
13:30
The first class is actually, he's a family man. He has three kids, and he's working as an engineer, and he has a high rank in his office. And this student has been with me for two years already. So he's consistently doing he just loves talking in English every day at least. Because in his company or in his daily life in Korea, he cannot really practice English. He just call and talk, just like us. We're doing article. 

speaker B
14:03
06:00. A.m.. Wow. 

speaker A
14:05
Sometimes there are also 05:00 a.m class. Yeah, I have that. Before 05:00 A.m., it was so hard. But this is the thing there in this kind of job, because in Korea, people really mostly people wakes up early to start their day early. Right? 

speaker B
14:26
I don't know. 

speaker A
14:33
That person was not a family man. He is a family man. He's working in a company that deals internationally. And he's really when he started, actually, he was really bad at English, actually, when he started. He even used a grammar book for kids because it's really bad for him, for his English. But you know what? As years passed by, it was really a boring class because it's also 05:00 A.m.. I'm still sleepy, and it's a video class at 05:00 A.m.. But I was surprised because he was so consistent and he improved. He doesn't want to use grammar book anymore, and he changed to article book. 

speaker B
15:25
I hope I can achieve that kind of improvement. 

speaker A
15:32
You can, actually. That's why I love using this article class. Because you just have to read it. And then the next day in our class, we just have to discuss it. Sharing thoughts. I really believe many of my students improve through article class. That leads to free talking. Yeah, you can do that. Others can. Why not you? Of course I can do if you don't have enough time. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. 

speaker B
16:08
Bye, guys. Bye.
