speaker A
00:06
There is laundry machine in my house. 

speaker B
00:17
You do laundry? 

speaker A
00:19
I did laundry. 

speaker B
00:21
You did laundry. I hope you're going to continue that routine. Yeah, you have to changing your lifestyle. What time did you sleep last night? 

speaker A
00:37
I went to bed at about 1230 in the morning. 

speaker B
00:46
At midnight? 

speaker A
00:48
Yeah, at the midnight. 

speaker B
00:50
I slept earlier than you. 

speaker A
00:58
Is you like the expression to say twelve? 

speaker B
01:06
Yeah. No, you can just say 1230 in the morning. 1230 midnight. If it's going to be midnight 1230 or 1230 noon? 1230 midnight. Midnight if it's a midday. So usually 1230 noon time. Sometimes. Really? When they say twelve, it's a little bit confusing because it's either what? What is it? Twelve midnight. 12:00 a.m.. 12:00 p.m. Sometimes the 12:00 a.m. You will be mistaken. They will say 12:00 a.m., they will say it's midnight. They will also say midday. So it's better to use twelve noon or twelve midnight so that it will really be identified. 

speaker A
02:03
Midnight. When did you want to do that? 

speaker B
02:10
When did you go to bed? 

speaker A
02:11
When did you go to bed? 

speaker B
02:15
Okay. After having that dish I sent you. After me and my family had some beer and dinner with this food. Last night I had a class ten to 1045 and then sleep. Yeah. 

speaker A
02:38
Was it a special day for your family? 

speaker B
02:41
No, not really. It's just that we asked my husband to cook this dish. It is his special dish. 

speaker A
02:57
Two I cooked. 

speaker B
03:04
I think it's all. 

speaker A
03:26
Made of fox and gucci jam. Pepper paste. Yeah, pepper paste. And I like the rod. 

speaker B
03:41
It's too spicy. 

speaker A
03:44
You don't just have a vital, you have to feed your I'm gonna send you mix it. Mix it with rice. 

speaker B
04:05
I thought you're just eating it with this alone. So it's kind of like this is your dish with the rice like this rice topping. 

speaker A
04:16
Rice topping. 

speaker B
04:20
I cannot bear spicy anymore. My stomach when gets older, stomach gets irritated. Wow. Is this your special dish that you can cook? 

speaker A
04:35
Special dish? What do you mean by that? Special dish? 

speaker B
04:38
The kind of dish that you are good at cooking. 

speaker A
04:41
No, I literally cook and this was my first time for cooking. 

speaker B
04:55
How did you know that one? Did you follow some YouTube? 

speaker A
04:59
I just searched one because I used to eat this because I liked it. My mom used to cook this for me when I was young. And I just come up with this dish. I don't know why. I found some recipe and I didn't cook. 

speaker B
05:29
But I guess it's a success. I mean, looking at the picture, it's a sesame seeds. You top it. You top it with sesame seeds, right? What is that? Sesame seeds? Those white ones. 

speaker A
05:46
I'm going to search it. Wait a second. It's sesame. 

speaker B
05:58
You had also a good weekend and now I can feel I also get fatter and fatter. Oh my goodness. Anyways. How about Saturday? What did you do? 

speaker A
06:15
I met by friends. I'm at my university friends who studied with me for a year on you. 

speaker C
06:35
And. 

speaker A
06:39
We drank we drank we drank. 

speaker C
06:45
Some beers, some Chinese chicken. 

speaker A
06:51
And we've took a picture. 

speaker B
07:00
Okay. You really had a great time. 

speaker A
07:04
This is me. 

speaker B
07:13
Are these your old friends or they are really your present friends? 

speaker A
07:19
Old friends and present friends. What are the difference? 

speaker B
07:26
Maybe when you say old friends so they are your friends even from before. So recent friends is usually past friends. They really know you the best. You've been friends with them from the past. The present friends is like you just met them and get to know them. 

speaker A
07:46
We went to the university at the same time. 

speaker C
07:51
So we were we are same ears. 

speaker A
08:08
How do you call the students who are in same year? 

speaker B
08:14
Colleague. 

speaker A
08:15
Colleague? Colleagues. 

speaker B
08:17
They were your colleague in university. 

speaker A
08:21
Yeah, they are. Yeah. 

speaker B
08:25
Okay. Good thing you had a great weekend too. It was Saturday. We didn't cook anything, but we went to just here in our town. Like we had some beer and some tempura French. Yeah. Every time we leave family with my family, it's all about eating and beer. Yeah. It doesn't matter if it's an expensive store or cafe or restaurant, but the important thing is we enjoy it together. 

speaker A
09:08
What kind of drink do you usually? 

speaker B
09:11
Strong beer. Strong beer we call it here in Korea. I think you already have San Miguel beer. 

speaker A
09:21
Miguel? 

speaker B
09:23
San Miguel beer? 

speaker A
09:26
Yes. 

speaker B
09:27
Yeah. Another beer that is the same company with San Miguel is Red Horse. Try to search it in Google. Redhorse beer. 

speaker A
09:43
Wow. 

speaker B
09:45
Yeah. We don't like drinking San Miguel because the alcohol content of San Miguel is too low. That it makes us just put weakens our body and just put to sleep. We already from ever since before, like when we started drinking beer. It's always the Red Horse because it's strong beer. 

speaker A
10:09
I didn't catch you at the first. Why do you don't like to drink San Miguel? 

speaker B
10:19
The alcohol content of San Miguel is low. Like I think 4% or 3%. I don't know. It's a different effect on us. It gives us headache or sleepiness or laziness or tiredness. 

speaker A
10:43
Is it because that some people has low alcohol percentage for you guys to. 

speaker C
10:54
View some kind of sleep needs? 

speaker B
11:02
No, hold on. Sorry. They are too loud outside. Okay. Yeah. Actually I have been a bad drinker ever since let's just say from college. I know. I learned drinking in high school. I don't really like alcohol that has a low percentage of content. So red horse, if you will check the red horse and the San Miguel beer content. Red Horse is stronger. I think it's 8% compared to the San Miguel. San Miguel really gives me a bad effect. 

speaker A
12:02
Can you describe the taste of lettuce? 

speaker B
12:11
How can I say it's just a beer. But the San Miguel for me is a bit bitter compared to the Red Horse. How can I say this. It's really a different taste. You can feel the strongness of the beer compared to the San Miguel. So every glass of it you can really feel the like this is a beer. This is the beer that we are looking for. How can describe it? Is it sweet? 

speaker A
13:02
Then I will try one and I will describe you how I taste. 

speaker B
13:09
Okay. But I know you will like Red Horse. Let's see you continue tomorrow. Okay. 

speaker A
13:18
Bye, guys. 

speaker B
13:20
Bye.
