Can you see me? 

speaker B
00:09
Yeah, I can see. 

speaker A
00:11
Can you see me? Yes, it's a bit dark. My son is still sleeping. Okay. Thank God it's Friday. 

speaker B
00:23
Wow. 

speaker A
00:31
What are your Friday or weekend plans? 

speaker B
00:35
I'm going to go to the university and actually this is my day of some kind of exhibition. 

speaker A
00:56
Exhibition in the university? 

speaker B
00:58
Yes, I have my little. 

speaker A
01:08
Experiment. 

speaker B
01:11
Yes, I have some kind of experiment. Exhibition? That where I exhibit my poster of a leader experiment. And you got it? 

speaker A
01:33
Yeah. What experiment is that? That you have to showcase? 

speaker B
01:38
I made some kind of simulation where? I made a simulation of an algorithm that tracks the positions of devices in a place. In a place? 

speaker A
02:11
Kind of like that's? Kind of like your invention or experiment. Okay. All I know is that's all about science. Okay, don't expand more. What's going to be your article for today? 

speaker B
02:43
Using device japanese handwashing stand. 

speaker A
02:52
At first I didn't understand this. No, I get it. 

speaker B
03:00
Ganon, which coin cell phones too. 

speaker A
03:10
So this means instead of water flowing, it's like ultraviolet? Something like that. 

speaker B
03:18
It might use water to wash your hands, but it's just ultrapiolet too for the smartphone. 

speaker A
03:36
Wow. So what are your thoughts on this invention? 

speaker B
03:49
I have heard about that the serpents are the most dirty things in daily lives and one of those writing says that the serpents are more dirtier than the how do you call it? The. 

speaker A
04:29
Yeah, from the toilet. And then if you're not doing some hygienes from your hands, you're just right away just washing your hands with water. With nomadically phones we use. 

speaker B
04:42
Right, but I thought that it is somewhat hard to wash my cell phones. I can wash my hands easily and by using this, that leaves my worries. 

speaker A
05:17
Oh, I get it already. You think that this invention will really become popular? It will be common. 

speaker B
05:40
Common? Common. 

speaker A
05:47
Now? 

speaker B
05:50
Yes, now. 

speaker A
05:52
Why do you say it will not be common? 

speaker B
05:57
First, the owner of a shop, owner of a restaurant needs to pay for this device first, the money and second, it would be some kind of new actions that the customers should take. So there should be some kind of hold for them to use them. Mainly, so far so good. Without this. 

speaker A
06:47
I wonder also if let's just say somebody or a store will install this one. So kind of like the store is investing into this kind of invention but no money back, right? Because it's going to be used for free, right? 

speaker B
07:09
Yes. 

speaker A
07:13
Because it can't be that if a person wants to use this, they should pay. I think it's awkward. This is kind of like a fountain water from the public place. You just have to use it. 

speaker B
07:27
Right, but it may take some kind of attention in high end premium places where the people go there pay much attention in temptation because I have seen many people who are not interested in Washington. 

speaker A
08:24
I don't even clean my phone. But of course my phone is not dirty. But I'm also one of those people who don't I'm not a clean freak. I can say clean freak. Like I'm not even here in my room. There are people who usually cleans every day because they are clean freaks. But I'm not like I even clean this room once a week. So my phone actually if I just notice my phone has some extra dust on the surroundings and I'll just remove the COVID and then wipe it and then that's it. But maybe this will work in big companies. 

speaker B
09:16
Yes, big companies and some high end restaurant. 

speaker A
09:23
Hospitals are willing to invest on this. Okay, are you a clean freak? 

speaker B
09:36
No, absolutely not. 

speaker A
09:41
Look at your room first. You're not a clean freak. But not messy, right? 

speaker B
09:48
Not in a boat. I'm in the middle. Whenever I go, I think that it is hard to clean. Now. It would be so much if I just let it go. 

speaker A
10:18
Let it be. I may not be a clean freak, but I also don't want a messier room. Well, thankfully I am a very minimalist person. I don't want unnecessary things in my room that are not useful for me. So I can say my room or our room is not messy. Okay, so what do you think are the household? Let's just generalize it. What do you think are the household or housework that men generally hate the most? 

speaker B
11:05
Men hate most. 

speaker A
11:19
Not all right. 

speaker B
11:24
I don't know. Maybe cooking danish skill. Cooking is who can these skills, not just effort, everything else such as clean loom or do the dishes, to wash the clothes. The kind of things needs just efforts, not skills. But cooking needs skills. So it is the most hardest, the hardest thing. 

speaker A
12:16
Okay. What do you think, household or houseworks that women hate the most? 

speaker B
12:37
How to call it dealing with getting. 

speaker A
12:41
A babies, taking care of the kids. 

speaker B
12:54
Cooking too? Yeah, because I have been cooking for just a couple of weeks ago and I found that this is kind of a world with stereo span because it is very hard to keep my mind in that kind of situation where I have to do this and do that and do something else altogether. My mindset should close in a parallel mode. 

speaker A
13:44
Cooking really well. When I cook, I rarely cook nowadays. Ever since I got married. Of course, I'm so very busy person. But when I want to cook, it's all about frying. If some example I want to fry some chicken, I just season it with salt and then cook. It simple, very simple. I don't want slice of onion, slice of garlic. A lot of mess. Not for me. I just want some fried fry. 

speaker B
14:14
Fry is hard too. 

speaker A
14:17
What? It's very simple. I guess it's the oil spilling that you don't like. 

speaker B
14:28
Maybe. 

speaker A
14:31
Okay, we also don't have enough much time. Let's continue this on Monday and enjoy your weekend. Okay. 

speaker B
14:37
You too. Bye.
